      "Something is wrong with the microphone... people can't hear me while on the phone. The reception is ok, Not great. However, these are not like the ones I've got with my I-phone. very deceiving.\n",
      "Not Apple Headphones. Scratched up case and the remote doesn't even work. You get what you pay for.\n",
      "The sound is not as good as my previous apple headphones. It just sounds flat and loud.\n",
      "It’s not Apple products. The sound is horrible\n",
      "Do not buy these knockoffs. Was expecting legit Apple headphones. Very bad sound quality.\n",
      "Good\n",
      "These are horrible and should be considered false advertisement. No stars\n",
      "This item was great!!  It even came a couple of hours earlier and they work well\n",
      "These felt like they were either refurbished or knock offs when I first got them and they lasted only a week before they stopped working. DO NOT BUY\n",
      "Good quality and came sooner than expected. Thanks!!\n",
      "I had these for a week and the buds broke apart. Do not buy these, just got to an Apple Store and get a good pair. I'm not able to replace them either through this seller.\n",
      "I ordered these headphones and the only way they work is if you hold pressure to keep them plugged in. I checked with other headphones to see if it had to do with my device and all the other headphones worked flawlessly\n",
      "BARGIN PRICE\n",
      "Unfortunately, I have to use a dongle in order to use these with my iPhone 8.  The sound quality is great and the volume buttons work too.\n",
      "Loved them!\n",
      "When I received the item the package was virtually destroyed and was stapled together.  A bit surprised it was even shipped in that condition.  The sound is deadened and not nearly what I would expect from “Apple” ear buds.  Advertising them that way is pure fraud.\n",
      "They were priced great, and sound great! Shipping was super fast\n",
      "Used it for two weeks and one of the headphones broke in half while taking it out of my ea.r.\n",
      "these are the most trash earbuds i have ever bought\n",
      "Terrible!\n",
      "Looks identical to the headphones provided but ARE NOT Apple earbuds. Flimsy material . Shipped in a scratched up Apple case. No bass on audio compared to a genuine pair\n",
      "I ordered these headphones expecting them to work and the momment I put them on they did not work AT ALL! I went to get a refund and they don’t allow refunds! Do not reccomend!!\n",
      "I bought these because my earbuds that came with my iPhone stopped working properly after two and half years, they would only play out of one ear and the remote didn’t work anymore so I bought these because I didn’t want to pay $30 from the Apple store to get new ones and these work great... they play out of both ears and the remote works too so I give it five stars!\n",
      "These did not work!!!! Do not waste your money!!!\n",
      "Left bud not functioning properly\n",
      "These are excellent. Great sound. I do wish the earbuds had the plastic/ rubber piece over them, but they are still comfortable.\n",
      "Although these do not seem to be original Apple earbuds, the quality is still good to use.\n",
      "Bought double pack. One of them had a mic that didn’t work right out of the box, the other has a right bud that failed after two days. Going to return and get another pair to see if I just got two lemons (which I’ve never received from apple directly)\n",
      "As soon as I plugged these in and tried them out on my standard library from my iPhone 6+ I knew something was wrong. There was a distinct crackling noise in the right earbud every time I moved my head. The material feels slick and cheap. Best of all, this item cannot be returned. Total loss, don’t bother for now. I will update should the company contact me.\n",
      "Garbage sound is really bad to deathBuy what you think worthI think it's just too bad. Buying the worst headphones is worth two dollars.Count postage!No bass!!!!!!!!!!\n",
      "Despite being advertised as authentic Apple headphones, these are not. After just two weeks of use one side of my headphones stopped working. You might think you’re getting a great deal because of the price but you’re just getting scammed with fakes.\n",
      "If I could rate this 0 stars I would 100%. I love how they fall apart and break just days after receiving them. I think I used them twice... One earbud detached. Both caps came off and one of the speakers disconnected and rdpped off. I don't want a new pair... I just want my money back for this junk.\n",
      "Bought these and they did not work good at all!  It sounds like your talking in a tube and makes weird noise.\n",
      "these aint real\n",
      "Deceptive product description and seller name. These are garbage headphones. Not Apple headphones. Opening a case with the bbb and cfpb. Not eligible for returns either.\n",
      "Good sound quality. However I did step on them and they cracked pretty bad which is my fault, just be careful.\n",
      "JUNK!!!!!!!!!!!\n",
      "Genuine Apple EarPods with standard jack feel comfortable and work great.\n",
      "Broke within 3 days. Bad\n",
      "It was functioning so well but one month later, one of the earphones are not working. I'm very dissappointed, lost my money.\n",
      "Very muffled sound. Most likely a fake Apple product!!!!!!\n",
      "The sound is not that bad but the volume button doesn’t work at all from the very first day!\n",
      "daughter like them\n",
      "I loved the earbuds\n",
      "Good product!\n",
      "works as expected\n",
      "Just purchased these recently, and the right headphone doesn't work. Would appreciate a refund or an exchange with a working set.\n",
      "let left ear doesn't even work. totally useless\n",
      "Garbage, fake Apple EarPods, never buy again, seller shouldn’t mention Apple in the description\n",
      "I bought these on Febuary 10, 2018 and the left earbud stopped working on April 11, 2018.\n",
      "Daughter loves them!\n",
      "Not official, these sound hollow and are very much a poorly constructed knock off. However they do work in the meantime. You get what you pay for\n",
      "Not working anymore\n",
      "Absolute trash. The remote broke in the first week, second week the left ear stopped working. I used them maybe 3-4 times for a few minutes. I’ve had many pairs of apple headphones and every single pair lasted me over a year of heavy use\n",
      "These earphones are unbearable. Whatever you try to listen to through them sounds like the artist is underwater or like the instrumental is increased in volume and their voice is drowned out. Even songs that I listen to on a daily basis are unrecognizable because the earphones also do this weird thing periodically where it’ll blast in volume with a glob of indecipherable noise. Don’t even dare think you can watch episodes or streams either, same results. I honestly hope that  i received a faulty pair rather than these earphones actually be this bad.\n",
      "Good quality  just like the original apple earphones\n",
      "Within a few weeks of usage one side of the EarPods stopped working.\n",
      "The microphone on the headphones does not work.\n",
      "amazing\n",
      "it's awful item i just bought it .. and i only got 1 item .. but i have bought 2 packs ! this is awful!!\n",
      "One side of the ear piece wasn’t working when I got them! I am so upset about this\n",
      "Just as expected.  Apple earbuds sound way better than the cheap ones sold at convenience stores.\n",
      "broken when arrived.\n",
      "The head phones broke after a week of useing them ear bud stopped working on one side then the other\n",
      "Authentic.\n",
      "Like everything except that the volume controls don't work with my moto phone.\n",
      "This product is straight up garbage. The first time I used these I got complaints about static and sounding far away. They look like real Apple headphones, but they're knock-offs and sound horrible. They're also non-refundable. Boo!\n",
      "One side of the ear ph dint work after a week,...\n",
      "One of the earbuds stopped working less than two weeks from delivery.\n",
      "These ARE NOT original Apple EarPods.  The sound is crappy compared to original Apple.  Sound goes in and out.\n",
      "The remote control buttons don't work.\n",
      "It broke after a while\n",
      "Much needed I can talk hand's free while I'm at work.\n",
      "As described.\n",
      "perfect\n",
      "Horrible sound quality. It’s not real Apple\n",
      "This earpods has a totally reversed channels of left and right.\n",
      "This product was not what was described as. I just got it and tried it out coming to find out that only one of the ear piece was working. I couldn’t hear anything on the right ear piece. I tried to return it for another one but it won’t let me return this product. Terrible! This is ridiculous!\n",
      "Excelente\n",
      "delivered as promised.\n",
      "Love them\n",
      "Amazing quality for a really good price.\n",
      "Nice , great quality\n",
      "One earphone broke within the week\n",
      "Knock off\n",
      "Buyer Beware!!!!  Poor quality, doesn't always work-looks like an apple product, but must be an apple reject. Worse of all company won't stand by the product and doesn't allow returns.\n",
      "The sound quality is good but what I don't like is that the buttons make this loud \"click, click\" noise. There is also a static noise when I plugged the headphones in but I'm not sure if it's my phone or the headphones but these are small things. Overall I'm happy\n",
      "These are FAKE! The quality is worse than the 2 dollar airplane speakers!\n",
      "worst product. it was damaged when it was delivered.\n",
      "I purchased the 2 pack and the mic on them doesn’t work well when speaking on the phone with them you have to hold it very close to your mouth for the person on the receiving end to hear you\n",
      "Garbage\n",
      "Feel lighter (most likely fake) than original Apple earbuds. Sound quality terrible. Mic doesn’t work. Just awful.\n",
      "They fell a part on the first day!!\n",
      "Very good\n",
      "they work good\n",
      "These almost immediately broke. I've never actually had a pair of Apple earburds simply stop working after three weeks, and these had barely even been used (I have another pair close to two years old that is still going).\n",
      "broke about 2 weeks after purchase :///\n",
      "Ordered two pairs they don’t even work... makes a nice prop though...\n",
      "There are horrible they both broke the first day I used them. One I dropped and the ear piece just fell apart and the other the wire broke and only one ear works DO NOT BUY\n",
      "If you touched the headphone jack, the right earbud stopped working.  There was also a lot of static.  Note: company has a no return policy.\n",
      "The right headphone blown out and I only had them for 3 days.\n",
      "I’ve gotten these earbuds before and I’ve always had good things to say. And this time everything is okay except sometimes when I drop them the covering of the earpiece come off!!\n",
      "I just opened mine and they have a shortage\n",
      "Absolute FAKE.\n",
      "I wore these for one day only and somehow they already broke. You can only hear in one ear and not the other. Also you can’t return them. I would not buy these again\n",
      "I bought these a few years ago and they lasted a solid year then the right one got really quiet. I ordered these again 3ish weeks ago. I got some nice AKG earbuds with my phone I just got. So I used them instead. They got stolen so I went back to these. They sent me 2 pair because on assuming sense one of the boxes had a chip knocked out of it they went ahead and sent 2 pairs. The first pair I started using during school so they got beat up pretty fast and again the right one got quite. So I switched to the 2nd pair. I've been careful JUST THIS WEEK with them and today as I'm writing this the right one completely stopped working. NO SOUND AT ALL. I would have given these a 1 star but the first pair I bought did last awhile. So spend a little more money and get some actual apple ones\n",
      "These are junk my daughter got them for Christmas they lasted about 3 weeks and the earpiece fell apart. So i got her second pair to replace these and they lasted just as long same problem the ear piece came apart again.\n",
      "I had these less than a week and the volume control didn't work. Then the right earbud stopped working and now they do not work at all! Disappointed.\n",
      "Everything works and doesn’t break easily so that’s a plus. Nothing really bad about just don’t use it as a mic\n",
      "Perfect headphones!!!  I have bought a lot of them.  My cat thinks they are chew toys if left out for a moment.\n",
      "Fake product, cheap materials, bad sound. Waste of money.\n",
      "They broke the second day\n",
      "I think this is a fake because the decrease volume button doesn’t click correctly. And sound is even worse than Apple earbuds. Sigh.\n",
      "Imitations didn't last and sound was totally different\n",
      "They broke in one week.\n",
      "after a month of use, the left ear completely stopped working. (probably because the plastic cover did not fit right and popped off constantly.) i do not believe these are really apple earphones. right out of the box they just didn’t feel the same. unhappy customer.\n",
      "I ordered 3 sets and they’re all low quality junk. The metal plug in part broke off two pair and the last pair only has sound in one ear. Don’t waste your money!\n",
      "They are already ruined.  I can't believe it.  My previous ones lasted almost for two years.  I am really disappointed.\n",
      "I bought 3 of those, each start having different issues (controls, sound, one ear will stop working, you name it!).\n",
      "Third pair I bought, each ome falls apart! Total junk!\n",
      "The sound sounds distant, and only one EarPod works now\n",
      "Ripoff. The sound quality is horrendous. And talk about cheap materials...\n",
      "These earphones suck! The sound is good, but they don’t stay in great and they hurt my ears a lot!\n",
      "Weird wire feel. Does not snap in well.\n",
      "It worked great for awhile and after the window was closed and we could not return\n",
      "The sound quality but the button and mic doesn’t work. It was a present and I felt so bad about it.\n",
      "Fake. Honestly its so annoying.\n",
      "The headphones broke within a week or two of usage\n",
      "Absolute junk. Broke after 3 weeks :(\n",
      "NOT Apple earbuds. Yes, they look like Apple earbuds and they DO work. But the sound quality is garbage compared to real Apple earbuds. Either I just happened to get a bad pair,  or this is a product you should avoid if you’re trying to listen audio with true quality.\n",
      "My package was lost in the process of shipping but the seller was able to track it immediately and deliver it on time. The product works great and literally feels and sounds like the same EarPods you would get from the Apple Store. Will recommend to anyone looking for Apple earphones at an inexpensive price!\n",
      "I should've listened to the reviews, but decided to take a chance given the price. Don't make the same mistake I did. These arrived with one earbud not working well, and then within 1.5 months only one earbud was working. I contacted seller but they curtly replied that it was beyond 30 (or 60?) days so there was nothing they would do. I replied to that hoping they would understand that it was a defective product from the beginning, but got no further response. Terrible quality, terrible experience.\n",
      "Quality of the earphones are good but they only lasted 2 months before the right ear bud shorted out.\n",
      "These headphones are terrible quality. Any audio that plays through them are echoey, also, the right earbud broke off within a week of the purchase. Super ticked that I can’t return them.\n",
      "Good\n",
      "Very high quality case and earphone.\n",
      "Worked great\n",
      "Stopped working after one usage, garbage.  Fake!\n",
      "Just bought and already no sound in right ear bud.  Bummer!  Can’t be the real deal... are these seconds?\n",
      "They are Fake and not OEM/original Apple earbuds. They Loik real in the photos, but they sound horrible. Total waste of my money.\n",
      "They seem to be fake. Audio quality is extremely poor.\n",
      "These are fakes. Knock-offs. Cheap and don’t work. Don’t buy.\n",
      "Purchased these and the left earbud was completely dead and did not work.\n",
      "Fast delivery, and the real deal.  Pretty good for just beat-around-headphones (for the gym, outdoor use, etc. )\n",
      "headphones didn't work\n",
      "I'm so upset with this purchase. I bought the headphones, but the left ear really struggles to work half the time. These were supposed to be brand new too. I'm definitely going to try and return them.\n",
      "The earphones work but the volume adjustments do not!\n",
      "Great pricing.\n",
      "Works great for the money. Apple doesn't make these anymore so I know they're knock offs, but these work very well--all controls work perfectly on my old iPod.\n",
      "They worked for less than 1 week!  I've already reordered another set !!\n",
      "must be a knockoff. defective; had an electrical buzz that never quit.\n",
      "Absolute junk do not buy\n",
      "My daughter's favorite headphones of all time.\n",
      "Malfunctioned product! Microphone doesn't work! Don't buy! Not real apple product! No customer service at all!\n",
      "i bought this item for my girlfriend because she needed new earphones but in return she got some earphones that did not work and one was even broken, horrible item to be honest\n",
      "apple quality, amazon price\n",
      "Finally!! they are original!! I was afraid, omg. Hahahha.\n",
      "A+++++++\n",
      "They are made out of this weird plastic nothing like the real Apple EarPods. And one bud stopped working after about 10 hours of use. Sound quality is not that great either.\n",
      "I bought these because I thought I lost my headphones. When I went to go use them I saw there was ear wax in the phone...which was not mine...yuck. These are supposed to be brand new and someone else used them. This is so okay. NEVER BUY FROM THESE PEOPLE!!!  I am so repulsed right now!\n",
      "They work great. I love apple headphones\n",
      "My old headphones broke after long years of use and I needed new ones. They work just like my old earphones\n",
      "Other than the obvious difference in physical quality considering these aren’t licensed Apple headphones, these have wonderful sound and have held up just like the licensed ones do!\n",
      "Still the best sounding, affordable and durable headphones ever.\n",
      "TERRIBLE QUALITY- stopped working 3days later :(\n",
      "One ear bud already not working after using for less than a week. Clearly arent real Apple headphones\n",
      "Broken upon receipt\n",
      "I just got them and it was good at first and the bass was sounding so good but then if you bend the wire it sounds so static and the sound cuts off. I think it was maybe along the journey to my home something hit it and affected it.If the seller could send a replacement with more protection around the earphones that would be amazing.\n",
      "Doesn’t work for one ear after a week\n",
      "Horrible quality. Wish I could return the product but I already threw away the package.\n",
      "I got these a little under a month ago, and at first they worked flawlessly I really did love them. But yesterday I was listening to my music and the right earbuds just stopped playing music, no more sound was coming from it. And about an hour later the left earbuds wouldn’t play music. I even tried turning the volume up all the way and still nothing.\n",
      "They are not the correct adapter - so useless\n",
      "Bought the two pack and neither one worked. you could only hear out of one ear bud. Very disappointed.\n",
      "Ok\n",
      "Very poor quality.\n",
      "Terrible sound\n",
      "These earbuds stopped working in a week. I tried to send them back but I’m unable to...I’m extremely disappointed in this.\n",
      "Do not buy from the source ny. It's a cheap knockoff, the actual material feels cheap and the sound quality is terrible and they are extremely quiet. Worst part is I can't even return it.\n",
      "Only one earbud worked.  This was a waste of money.\n",
      "Broke just a few days over a month after I bought it. I've owned ear pods before and never had a problem. They look pretty but don't last long. It seems to be too late to get a refund; what a waste of money.\n",
      "Emmmmmmm I got it a few days ago and the left side of the EarPods doesn't have any sounds ..... it is a broken one  ...  \n",
      "My mic doesn’t work. And I can’t return it\n",
      "Very poor sound quality, causes headaches. Sounds very muffled with high treble. Either these are defective Apple EarPods with a new design for the selector button or these are knock-off Apple products. I'm surprised after having read all the great reviews of this product, I thought I was getting a deal.\n",
      "Lost my headphones and these worked perfectly well! Recommend!\n",
      "Doesn’t work\n",
      "stopped working within three months of use\n",
      "its okay but they dont last long there like a disposable lighter.\n",
      "Not sure if this is the same for everyone, but I was delivered headphones with only one earbud working. Can't use these and now passed the return window. Unfortunate.\n",
      "Bought as a backup set. Opened and fell apart in 2 weeks. Do not buy from this  refurbished retailer.\n",
      "I have owned these one month and the right ear bud became loose and stopped working.  They look and feel OEM and sound pretty good, but I have never had a real Apple earbud fail like this... let alone in a month.  I opened the right ear bud to see what happened and one of the wires has broken... not only that, but the construction method and the wires do not match my OEM Apple earbuds.  I have decided to give these a 2nd chance and chalk it up to fluke and try a new pair.  I will buy another and update with another review....\n",
      "The headphones are comfortable and great when they work. These have issues when I start running, they will pause and unpause, and will lower and raise the volume all by themselves . Do not recommend buying these again.\n",
      "FAKE. They replicated the box and the writing on the wires. But I had them for 3 weeks before the controls broke suddenly and the sound cut out a lot. I DON'T RECOMMEND. Buy through apple.com instead!! I even got the fulfilled by Amazon ones... still FAKE.\n",
      "They broke right after I got them\n",
      "Only worked for two weeks. Right earbud does not work anymore... and if I can I'd like to exchange it or figure something out but seller does not have contact info posted where I could see it.\n",
      "Remote doesn’t work\n",
      "I just recieved the headphones today and when comparing them to an original pair I have discovered several signs of them being counterfeit. 1) The wiring is thinner and has a more rigid feel than the genuine pair. 2) The frequency response is lower and the EQ is scooped, resulting in a tinnier sound than the genuines. 3) The microphone barely picks up any sound and it also has a a sort of clicking static sound to it. 4) The third party seller, Universal Goods and Sales did not include any receipt not does it offer a return policy at all.\n",
      "I bought these literally two days ago and already one side of them doesn't work. I DEMAND RESTITUTION.\n",
      "I bought these headphones and the day i bought them they broke, i had just put them in my ear and they fell apart.\n",
      "Yea, they're counterfeit. This is a bad idea, seller. Apple is kind of a powerful company and loves suing competitors who AREN'T knocking off their products.\n",
      "They're fake. The mic doesn't work and the sound quality is terrible. Don't waste your money.\n",
      "Thanks Good Product\n",
      "Good product. Late delivery!\n",
      "These EarPods are a cheap knock off.  They stopped working within two months of use.\n",
      "No drawbacks real Apple headphones, best replacements you can buy.\n",
      "Not legit, and the sound quality sucks. Sounds like the china junk you get off of wish.\n",
      "Horrible. Got them and within one day one of them stopped working. Do NOT BUY THESE\n",
      "Didn’t hold up as it stop working after a week or so\n",
      "This item came defective, one side doesn’t work. And it drops the calls\n",
      "Fake apple product. Don’t buy. I bought 2 and they are both broken.\n",
      "Worked for maybe a month. Disconnected and started playing music out loud often and just overall fell apart quickly\n",
      "Lasted less than 3 months before they started having issues.\n",
      "One side stopped working after 3 weeks of use\n",
      "It broke after the second use of it. The right earbud plus the volume buttons stopped working\n",
      "They broke after a week\n",
      "These broke after a couple of weeks. Cheap and waste of money.\n",
      "Left ear bud doesn’t work\n",
      "Great ear buds. Worked great!\n",
      "excellent product, 100% recommended.\n",
      "yeaaah good i love it\n",
      "Broke and does not work.\n",
      "fake,cheap, almost broken on arrival.\n",
      "The product was in good shape, but after awhile (less than a month of usage) it stopped working\n",
      "I was so sacred to buy this based off of some weird reviews but I am SO happy with my purchase. I got it delivered 2 Days earlier than I even expected and the headphones where in perfect new conditions. Sound quality is amazing!\n",
      "breaks every time\n",
      "This item broke soon after receiving it. It was not abused in any way and the left earbud ceased working.\n",
      "I like\n",
      "These airphones are trash I jus got these airphones and only one side is working\n",
      "The sound quality on these is muffled. They look like Apple headphones, but the sound is nothing like them.\n",
      "When you receive the headphones you’ll notice they’re not authentic. They don’t share the same quality and I can’t even use them to talk in the phone. All they’re good for is music.\n",
      "They broke within a week....\n",
      "Wow these are totally a waste of money i bought these once and they didnt last long at all i thought maybe i dropped them in water or something so i bought a new pair and they literally stopped working within 15 mins of use and you can hear static in the jack .. pissed\n",
      "daughter loves it\n",
      "The product complies with the description and the delivery was made in a timely manner\n",
      "Came with marks and the mic compartment was open\n",
      "Not even a month of having these the right speaker busted. I use these headphones for making calls with work and I'm not blasting my speakers when I'm on the phone. Disappointed in this purchase especially since headphones usually last me a good 6 months.\n",
      "These are not real apple.  Speaker when talking isn’t great but sound is fine and shape is same as apple ones.  Overall for $10 they work as they should.\n",
      "I recommend you purchase them from apple.\n",

      "It  was really poor quality, it broke in 3 days after normal use, definitely not authentic apple earphones. Mic/volume up+down buttons were not functional. And earbud kid broke, music stopped playing from the right ear. I suggest you find another seller if you are looking for apple earphones.\n",

      "Perfect.  Thank you\n",
      "These headphones aren’t worth the $10 I spent on them. They broke two days after I used them, and the two days I had them were not impressive. They amplified the music I was listening to, so everyone could hear it. It was a distraction to me and everyone else, not to mention I got a few questionable looks for the music I was listening to. The buds easily popped off, as well as the volume control button that I tried to save with tape. Do yourself a favor, and splurge for some legit headphones.\n",

      "The headphones are shorting out and I have only had them for a month or so.\n",
      "fragile and not work it\n",
      "Bad, no way these are apple. On one pair the left bud is much louder than the right and on the 2nd pair the right bud is loud than the left, making listening to music annoying without taking one bud out. The mic doesn't work either. Recommend buying the way cheap version of these headphones because these are crap too.\n",

      "I am no athlete, but like to paint and do other activities with my hands. It is nice to have my phone away from the location of where I am painting so I do not get something on it. My only complaints are that it is hard to keep them in your ears sometimes and they are a little bulky.\n",
      "It's Not bad values worth.\n",
      "I am ashamed of apple. they have very good quality things,but what i experienced was horrible. So when i got them they were ok, like they weren't the best, i couldn't talk with them on, couldn't change the song, and in general couldn't use the mike thing. Then after a week or so, i took them out to use them and i find that one earbud stops working. so then after another week i take them out again just more careful cuz i dont want the second earbud to stop working and i find that the second earbud stopped working! i was mad, and then i find that one of the cord has been stretched out. i recommend that no one buy this, its drugstore quality.\n",
      "This are horrible headphones. I assume they're knock-offs (despite saying they're Apple and coming in a branded white Apple case) because as soon as you open them, you can tell they're not the real deal: they don't feel anything like the silicone, somewhat-resistant wire casing on real Apple headphones. Truthfully, I wouldn't care that they're not Apple if they worked, WHICH THEY DO NOT. Unfortunately, I bought three pairs in one order (I loose headphones a lot) and each one didn't work from the moment I took it out of the case. You can see from the photo I've attached where the wires arrived bent the the speaker is popped open. I'm normally so pleased with product sold on Amazon (especially those rated #1 seller, which these are) but I'm sorely disappointed with these.\n",
      "The left ear bud quit working after a month or less. I was quite dissatisfied.\n",
      "These are counterfeit parts. Fake. Even the plastic case that appears to be Apple is fake. The wires are way too thin compared to the Apple product. The Amazon product listing indicates these are Apple ear buds. They clearly are not.\n",
      "Complete knock off that are terrible quality. This is a scam!!!\n",
      "it was not working good\n",

      "Really good purchase, bought three and they came new. They also came much earlier than expected. Totally will buy again.\n",
      "I use Apple EarPods regularly, and I can tell you with complete confidence these are fake. The buttons on the mic do not work the same as the authentic ones do, and within a week of having the headphones both ear piece covers came off. When they did I could see that the way the headphones are set up are not at all similar to the way Apple produces and puta together theirs. Disappointed.\n",

      "Terrible. Fake. Low quality\n",
      "I bought them at the end of January, even tho it’s mid March the right one does not work.\n",
      "Bought this a month ago and the left ear just went out today. The only pros were that it looked and felt like the original earbuds that came an iPhone and the longer cord was a plus. But wished it lasted longer than a month\n",
      "I was weary at first seeing the price being $9.99, and I've heard how amazon is crawling with fake apple earbuds, but I saw that these had mostly good reviews so I decided to buy it. I was very surprised to hear the sound quality and rich bass tones of genuine apple earbuds when I listened through them. Great buy, especially if you don't want to pay $30 for them from Apple. The thing is it all depends on supplier, When I bought them it was sold by Accesory liquidators, but after I bought them the seller on the same listing changed to a different company, so I'd say it all depends on who amazon is pushing at the moment as to what you get.\n",

      "Sound is fine, but they literally fall out of your ears every 10 seconds. Got these to replace my old apple earbuds that someone broke, and I wish I had the old style. Sitting still at a desk and they don't stay in.\n",

      "Only one headphone works . It’s a rip off . And the box that the headphones come in was like cracked .\n",
      "I believe that this product is a knock-off of the actual Apple part. The seller seems to be misrepresenting the authenticity of the product. Within a couple of wearings, the right ear bud stopped functioning, and within a few more wearings, the cap fell off the left bud! Seller, if I am in error, please contact me and we can figure out a way to replace the defective merchandise and I'm happy to write you a revised review if in fact the product works the second time around.\n",
      "Awesome.\n",
      "DO NOT BUY! First of all these aren't even official apple earbuds, this is false advertisement. From the beginning the earbuds would stop the song playing or bring up siri without me doing so. Now the controls buttons are non responsive completely. On top of that they shock my ear! DO NOT RECOMMEND!!!!!\n",
      "Although the name does imply Apple, these are just a very cheap knockoff.  It's very evident in the materials used and the poor assembly.The sound quality is ok but I'm sure that will start to suffer soon. The wire coverings are very thin and the plastic near the headphone jack keeps slipping down over the jack causing it to not connect until it's re-positioned. We would not purchase from this vendor a 2nd time.\n",
      "These quit working within a week!  Very frustrated!  Do not recommend even though price and description looked great!  If it looks to good to be true, it probably is!\n",
      "Started shocking my ears at the gym\n",
      "Product looked like they were on sale before but still good though.\n",
      "Not a good product. One side quit working within about 2 months of use. It still looks brand new so God only knows why one side isn't working.\n",
      "I liked these, someone eventually stole then though.. sigh\n",

      "If you are only listening to the \"AM Jams\" you will be satisfied.  Otherwise, the quality of sound is terrible.  These suck with ferocity.  Severely disappointed Apple.  Did not match the description.\n",
      "Amazing headphones\n",
      "They Nah real but they okay they  fake lol  but  they sound good\n",
      "I have bought this product twice in less than 5 months. I’ve taken really good care of my earphones but unfortunately they did not last for a long time. I really wish I get a refund or something.\n",
      "They didn’t work at all\n",
      "Well, they worked fine for two weeks, the night before they worked perfectly fine, the next morning, right ear doesn't work anymore.\n",
      "As expected.\n",
      "These are knock off earbuds\n",
      "This is a really great deal. It does arrive in the fancy Apple shell that is normally inside the other even fancier Apple box for packaging, but instead of fancy double-packaging from Apple its fancy inner shell is just in a foam envelope. It arrived perfect condition. Seems like a bulk-rate liquidation sale. I have several I bought from the Apple store retail (before it was discontinued), and this seems genuine Apple..\n",
      "These headphones sound horrible. Spend an extra $10 or $20, skip a fast food meal and get a better set. Waste of money. Sounds like a radio from 1993 in my ears.\n",

      "No way these are genuine.  The wire has the wrong covering.  The volume randomly increases when using these with my iPhone\n",

      "Good headphones\n",
      "I thought these had good sound and they worked well. The pause button worked but the mic didnt, and the earbud broke off of the headphones in about a week. Not even worth $10 :(\n",
      "Terrible quality knock-off of a good product. I would highly recommend buying from another seller, these are not even worth the shipping price (which was free with Prime). The left earbud does not even work and sound quality in the “good” side is mediocre at best\n",
      "These are trash knockoffs. I can’t believe they can use Apple and the model in the title. Seems like false advertising. Don’t buy. Spend your money on anything else.\n",
      "The audio is terrible and the volume/pause buttons don’t even work. This is not what I paid for\n",

      "JUST GREAT\n",
      "These earbuds are fake! When i got them i started to listen to music then one day no music was coming out of one earbud hen the day after that the earbud cord was stretched out\n",
      "Although the packaging has Apple logos on it, the quality of the product is so bad that it suggests strongly that it is not genuine. Buy it at the full price from Apple. Avoid this if you care about sound quality at all (and if you don't care about sound quality, there are cheaper headphones out there for the same quality). The only thing this product has is that it looks like an Apple product.\n",

      "Headphones are defective. Only the right ear is working after a week use.\n",
      "This is a terrible headphone.\n",
      "Disappointed in what I got. The feel of the earphones is very generic, and the sound quality is pretty terrible. Maybe I got unlucky, but I won’t be buying off this listing again.\n",
      "I got these about a month ago. They worked fine until today when the right one suddenly stopped functioning. I have not used ten abnormally or excessively.\n",
      "The head phones dropped on the floor and broke. Very cheap definitely not an Apple product\n",

      "I bought a few of these headphones in January and each of them was broken by March. In both cases the sound diminished in one of the earbuds to the point where they were unusable.\n",
      "I bought two of these to 'test' because of the mixed reviews. They work great, very happy! Went to purchase more and they are sold out ... hopefully, the next lot is as good as this batch. I will definitely be purchasing more when they are back in stock.\n",
      "These are fake!! Nothing like my Apple ones. It’s wrong to say they are Apple. The quality is not even comparable\n",
      "Fast shipping, they work great.\n",
      "Ok\n",
      "Work great!\n",

      "A pretty good deal, they’re still working well!\n",
      "Fit and finish is fine, looks like the real thing, remote buttons feel good, but there is almost no bass response and the set I received has a bad ground right out the package - crackling when plug is turned in stereo jack. Manufacturer should be ashamed to make these.\n",
      "Broke within two weeks.\n",
      "THIS ARE NOT REAL APPLE HEADPHONES. These are a very good fake, first thing I noticed was the inferior sound quality next was the fact that the button was way harder to press, lastly I realized the microphone is VERY bad. All these I compared to a used pair of REAL apple headphones from the original iphone box. It is very hard to tell the difference just by looking but these are FAKE and the quality shows DO NOT BUY THEM if you are looking for real apple headphones.\n",
      "I thought these were going to be great but I have had them for less than 2 months and one bud is already dead. Very disappointing.\n",
      "Mic picks up a keyboard and the dogs outside better than the person wearing these headphones.\n",

      "They didn’t work and I never even got a refund for them\n",
      "These were ok for a week, but then they stopped playing about every five minutes, even though my phone showed the music was still playing, and it would take five minutes for them to start playing again. Don’t buy these they are total trash they’re so fake. Spend an extra $10 on good earbuds, don’t buy this cheap knock-off.\n",

      "Sound is OK, and the microphone works, but the volume control and advance buttons do not.  Seeing what a short life span bonafide Apple earphones have, and how pricey they are to replace, I guess I can deal with the fact that I have to manually adjust volume, etc. in return for a very cheap price.\n",
      "Broke in 2 months. Every time the wire gets bumped, no matter how slight, the sound goes nuts. If I plug them in and put my phone in my pocket it unbearable. Junk\n",

      "The volume key  and  don't work\n",
      "Garbage. These come packaged in Apple packaging and look like Apple buds, but they are terrible. The good Apple buds have a thinner cable that connect the buds to your device. These have a thicker cable. I would never buy from here again. Happened to find a genuine set of Apple buds at Walmart with the 3.5mm jack and they're perfect. Nice surprise since they're hard to find in an actual store since the buds with the lightning adapter has come out.\n",

      "I have had two pair of these for less than a week, both are broken. One, the ear bud fell apart when taking it out of my pocket. The other lost one side of audio when the slightest tug was made on the base connection.  If these are truly Apple made, they've allowed their production quality drop since they went to wireless.  Last set of \"Apple\" earbuds I'll ever buy.\n",

      "I’m satisfied with the item . Did a good job! It was delivered as promised!\n",
      "Works great\n",
      "These earpods simply did not work\n",
      "Don’t buy these. I am positive these are knock offs. Materials are different, buttons are harder to push and less responsive. Sound quality is terrible.\n",
      "Horrible headphones. The volume sounds low and they look cheap. These earphones don't look like apple headphones.\n",
      "Only one side worked.\n",
      "Bought two pairs first lasted one month few days. Just enough to be out of warranty and the amazon return window. Left earbud quit working on first set already. Very disappointed.\n",
      "It only works for two months and can not return it\n",
      "Real deal.\n",
      "The only problem was that it came 2 days after the day it said, but everything it's perfect besides that.\n",
      "I hated them! My headphones are already broken!!! Never getting anything from here again!\n",
      "The product I received was used with ear wax in the earbud area.\n",
      "Broke within a week. I demand a refund for this ripoff.\n",
      "DO NOT BUY THESE. I bought them through DistrictSale and the sound quality was terrible and after one week, the right earbud completely broke aka you literally can't hear anything. This is a scam- stick with the known retailers. I'm never buying headphones off Amazon again.\n",
      "Love it. Would order it again\n",
      "Worked good for a month now 1 headphone doesn't work and only had the headphones for a month\n",

      "These are FAKE / COUNTERFEIT!!!  These are not an Apple product and the performance and quality is terrible.\n",
      "Sound stopped working after one use\n",
      "This is a great buy considering that they would go for $30 on the apple website. This shipped fast to me, it came 3 days earlier than the expected delivery date. As far as I know, they're authentic because they sound the same as the ones that came with my iPhone and have a great sound. I was looking into replacing the ones that I had before because my bunny chewed them up and this a great deal for me and was also really worth the price.\n",
      "i just ordered three of these, one for myself and two for my son. I just plugged in mine to my Pixel 2 phone and I immediately noticed that the Left Earbud does not work.\n",
      "The EarPods work very well.\n",
      "Within one day my daughter could only hear out of one ear.  The last one's she got lasted about 2 years though\n",
      "Not very happy - the wiring popped out of the cover. very disappointed because I could not return as it is a hassle\n",

      "I was sitting down listening to music and all of a sudden my left headphone stopped working. I would like to know if you guys can send a replacement pair \n",
      "These earbuds just arrived.  Definitely not the same sound quality as the pair that came with my i-phone.  I guess these will work for making hands-free phone calls, but not for listening to music.\n",
      "The packaging is a great dupe, but as soon as I picked up the earbuds I knew they were not the real thing. They were much too light. These are NOT apple headphones. They have almost no bass at all, and they were very quiet. I'm even more annoyed because I waited too long to return them and now I've lost $19. I ended up going to BestBuy and paying full price for the actual apple product.\n",
      "Failed! Don’t buy. It’s as simple as that.\n",
      "Bought in November and stopped working by February. Don’t waste your money.\n",
      "These are clearly bootleg headphones repackaged as an Apple product.\n",

      "These are counterfeit knockoffs. Bought these to replace the worn out pair that came with my ageing iPhone 6.\n",
      "I bought the wrong ones and didn't realise they weren't for the iPhone 7 or 8 but it's ok i just passed them to the kids that could use them. The price was just too good to beat\n",
      "item was not as advertised.  was defective, not capable of switching/pausing tracks as listed in description.  Informed vendor, who told me this model was not able to do so.\n",
      "These have worked great so far and the price is good. I tend to need a new pair every few months and will start buying these from now on as a less expensive alternative.\n",
      "Do NOT waste your money.  Unless you enjoy returning your purchases.  These arrived already broken.  Only one earbud works.\n",
      "The right ear bud cover fell off after 2 weeks\n",
      "\n",
      "Do not work correctly\n",
      "The earphones were good for a week, after that the right earphone stopped working over night I didn’t even use them.\n",
      "still enjoying it, as we speak.\n",
      "Great product.  Thanks\n",

      "Get what you pay for. Volume button doesn’t work. People can’t hear you when on a call.\n",
      "These were fake earpods. I compared them to my previous earpods that are broken from one earpiece, and they were trash. I would rate one star if I could. The mesh was a different color from the real earpods, so don't buy!\n",
      "Do not buy!! Mine broke within a week!!!!!! \n",
      "DO NOT BUY. DOESN'T WORK The jack doesn't stay connected unless you hold it in. You won't get sound unless you hold it into the jack. Otherwise it just pops out and disconnects. I knew I was getting low quality with the price, but these don't even work. I just pulled it out of the case about 5 seconds ago and it's already in the trash. Doesn't work with laptop or phone. Again, DO NOT BUY. DOES NOT WORK.\n",
      "fakehorrible sound compare to earpod come with my iphone.\n",
      "Same as others. Perhaps the price should be a clue but this seems like it should be fraud or false advertising...with so many verified reviewers saying this, why does Amazon keep allowing them to sell?\n",

      "As expected!\n",
      "These are the absolute worst headphones I've ever purchased. It hasn't even been a week since I got them and they are already dead. If you buy these you get what you pay for.\n",
      "Item was damaged when I received it.\n",
      "They work good... but they aren’t authentic\n",
      "Love them\n",
      "They appear to be and work like an OEM set of Apple earbuds.\n",

      "Terrible stopped working after not even a day of slamming then\n",
      "The touch and feel looks like good quality. But one ear bud  stopped working after a week... very disapointed.\n",
      "Microphone, volume buttons, and pause/play button stopped working after 1 week of light use.\n",
      "I bought these earbuds about a month ago and they are straight falling apart.  The sound in the right bud is muffled and the 3.5mm jack itself is losing the fitting around the neck.  I only use them a couple times a week is the thing so I don’t know why they’re so defective.\n",
      "Cord tears easily\n",
      "Poor quality. I do not believe the buds we're new.\n",
      "Literally did not work within 15 minutes of opening product. I guess they are just cheap headphones\n",
      "Good sound quality, sit comfortable in ear. It's Apple\n",
      "THESE ARE AMAZING!! they work super well came in the signature packaging. I recommend​ 10/10.\n",
      "So fake. And worse, they’re used fake ones!\n",
      "Perfect! Great price.\n",
      "only one ear works...\n",
      "I thought I was buying new, inexpensive OEM Apple EarPods but after being disappointed by their overall performance, I suspect these are either: not OEM Apple EarPods, or they are poorly refurbished OEM Apple EarPods because they are terrible. I bought these in November of 2017 but I could tell right away they were poor quality and after 2 months stopped working properly all together. Right out of the box, I noticed the first thing I disliked about these EarPods: the built-in remote/microphone assembly clicked extremely loudly. It clicked so loudly that the person on the other end of a phone call could hear it clicking when I used it to raise or lower the call volume. After 2 months of use, the click remote stopped working properly when I would try to skip, fast forward, or rewind a music track. The second thing I disliked about these EarPods was the poor microphone quality. The microphone was so bad that during phone calls, the person on the other end could barely hear my voice unless I held it up to my mouth almost literally touching my lips. This is extremely annoying because I use the EarPods quiet often to make hands-free phone calls while driving or writing something down for school or work. The sound quality coming from the EarPods themselves was pretty standard but overall, these EarPods were very poor quality and would not recommend them. I actually threw them away and went for the $30 for EarPods from Apple.\n",
      "They're fakes and broken!!! Avoid at all costs.\n",
      "very useful, thanks.\n",
      "These are FAKE.  Do not buy!  No bass...hollow cheap sound.\n",
      "fast shipping and i love this head phones\n",
      "Poor quality. The metal part that goes inside audio jack fell out with no force or pressure. It was gift for someone but could not return because they were disposed of.\n",
      "Do not buy!  One earbud cracked open after only 4 weeks of normal use.  The seller did not take refunds.  So save your time and trouble and get a reliable pair.\n",
      "broke after 1 month normal use, no accidents with product\n",
      "Usual excellent Apple quality and fit.\n",
      "i was very skeptical before ordering it. i just recieved it and it is wroking perfect !! worth it!\n",
      "Break easily\n",
      "These are not real Air Pods. They look like Air Pods, but the sound is tinnie and the plastic is thin. Ifyou like the real thing spend a little more and get it.\n",
      "Sound\n",
      "Good product! Fast shipping!\n",
      "Earphones did not work.\n",
      "These didn't work\n",
      "These earphones were at good use at first until their other day, one of them just stopped working. (The Left Earbud) I was playing my music (On Low) and then my left ear bud stopped working! Other than that, there’s good bass in the earphones and they came in the package clean and tidy.\n",
      "These were ok, until my dog ate it.\n",
      "These were useless, the left ear bud didn't work. I sent these back for a refund, bought off of Apple.com\n",
      "stopped working in one ear like 1 week after getting them\n",
      "These are ok for the price, the plastic casing came apart after a month and a half of use.\n",
      "Little brother loved them exactly what he wanted\n",
      "these are authentic apple earbuds that come with any phone older than the iPhone 7\n",
      "I received this for Christmas but did not get the chance to open and use them until January.  When I opened the case it broke (the case) from the base. I thought “no big deal”.  When I plugged the earbuds in to listen to music on my phone there was a short in the wire and it made the music cut out on one side (the left side).  Not sure if they can be returned this far out from purchase or not.  Pretty disappointed to say the least.\n",
      "broke within two weeks (cap fell off left earbud, speaker fell out), terrible sound\n",
      "It’s really nice that I could buy a product from a company that I could completely trust. I really like this product too because it also is not fake! yes I know all the people saying it’s fake no it’s not and also it’s very cheap so get one!\n",
      "Faaaake\n",
      "These are great.  They fit great and I really like them.\n",
      "good quality\n",
      "The quality of them was really good, it sounds just like an apple earpod. The only thing that I really didn't like was that the volume thing doesn't work, but the microphone does work.\n",
      "These are the real deal not the cheap ones I was buying at the $1 store.\n",
      "These are great head phones with good base. Just like the regular pair that come with the phone.\n",
      "My earbuds worked great for a few hours. One side quit working & then next. Disappointed.\n",
      "Last two days and broke\n",
      "The speaker got blown in like 2 days of use\n",
      "The earbuds are great. I was a little worried about whether they were real (or would even work) based on all the negative ratings, but I went through the sellers and checked individual ratings and number of ratings. I got the earbuds today- they look and sound legit. Sound is fine, mic and controller are fine. Good product for the money. I got mine from Electronic Club.\n",
      "They just quit working. I thought they were perfect. I take good care of them and make sure not to pull out of my phone too hard and I store them properly. The volume buttons work but I can't hear any noise.\n",
      "Not Apple. Quality is very poor. Sound is very poor. Ear buds are very poor. Don't need a cheap imitation. Aside from that, they're great. (Sarcasm intended.)\n",
      "This audio quality is not so good that it look like.I used it someday.Hopefully everyone should avoid this...\n",
      "These are NOT real Apple headphones.\n",
      "I mean my ears hurt after a while but I’m not complaining. They work. Just don’t use them on full volume- you’ll go deaf eventually and blow the speakers\n",
      "I like it, the sound is good. The only thing is that if I move the earpods too much they start making a weird sound which annoys me some times, other than that is good.\n",
      "Everyone.. DO NOT waste your time with these. I was going to buy the Apple EarPods at Walmart for $29 but figured I’d save some money and get them here. They can’t be real because on the second song the left earbud quit working. Literally THE day I opened them. JUNK!\n",
      "Broke with a week, but at least within the return period.\n",
      "There’re still working\n",
      "The quality is amazing, and they don't break as often compared to other brands I've used. While I don't own an iPhone yet, Apple certainly does well when it comes to these things!\n",
      "Volume buttons didn't work\n",
      "Good for the price.\n",
      "the earphones themselves work perfectly but the mic/controller doesn’t work for crap, basically just there for show, could’ve just bought regular earphones. im sad.\n",
      "Very good\n",
      "Fake and broke after a month. It didn’t dawn in me until I was in Shenzhen China last month and saw stall after stall of people hand wrapping knock off Apple earbuds in the exact same “non-retail” packaging as these that these are not genuine Apple product. Then mine broke, rattle in the right ear like something came unglued. Steer clear.\n",
      "Just what I needed!\n",
      "Were a great replacement for the ones I lost and the pair I'm probably about to lose ;-)\n",
      "recently bought the Apple ear pods, they where delivered before the date , packaged very well, item came on original apple case, work well. I would definitely repurchase again if needed too. so far I don't , they have a good sound.\n",
      "Product stopped working within days on the left earpod and the right let out a shock while in use and the pair was promptly thrown away. Do not buy!\n",
      "They already broke apart.\n",
      "Didn't think they would be what I was wanting after reading some of the reviews. But to my surprise they were just like the ones I received with my iPhone. Very satisfied specially for the price!\n",
      "I wish I could give these less than one star. I used them for the first time today and they're already glitching out and shocking me. Very disappointed.\n",
      "These are not real Apple headphones. Although they look just like apple headphones, they'll break very quickly.\n",
      "There great and work purfectly\n",
      "Not a pair of authentic apple earbuds. The coating protecting the wires is really thin and this causes weird bends. I've had these for a little over a month and one side of the controls has fallen off! The controls in general are wonky and really frustrating.\n",
      "One of the earbuds doesn’t work and it hasn’t even been a month I’m so disappointed\n",
      "Nope. These are fake and are NOT Apple quality earbuds and are returnable for $0 so a waste of money. I tried them once and the person on the other end said I sounded like I was in a tin can. I switched back to my real Apple earbuds and he said it was like night and day. DO NOT BUY.\n",
      "Only one side worked but, everything else was fine\n",
      "Bought for my son. He needed replacement for the ones that came with his iphone. He says they are great. Just like the ones that came with his phone.\n",
      "At first look, these are seemingly the authentic apple earbuds. But then you put them in your ears and realize the sound quality is terrible. Also, they seemingly skimped on whatever production process helps to avoid electric shock, and these earbuds are consistently shocking static electricity into my ear canals— kind of insane!\n",
      "works well and lasts a while\n",
      "that that they have great hearing\n",
      "I've had these headphones for about a month and the left earbud doesn't work anymore. The sound quality is quite tinny compared to the Apple headphones that have come with my iPhones despite being much older.\n",
      "Bought it new since I didn't want earwax. works really good.\n",
      "Quality product.\n",
      "Fell apart. Earpiece came apart after inside cover came off. Only has 2 month.\n",
      "Just what I wanted.\n",
      "Very bad quality...\n",
      "Broke in less than a month\n",
      "REALLY good price\n",
      "at first it was great but then in THE FIRST DAY the volume stopped working. then a week later it broke in half. please dont buy this\n",
      "Right out of the package, the ear buds made a noise as if something was loose inside them. Have had bad luck ordering from Amazon so just kept them. Now they're affecting the way my daughter's phone is acting. My daughter doesn't want me ordering anything from Amazon again and I work at BNA3.\n",
      "The volume and pause button would make siri continuously pop up and I'd be unable to listen to music. After a few days they stopped working altogether.\n",
      "This is one of the biggest POS I have ever got on this website, and I have seen some real junk.\n",
      "Don’t buy. Worked for abou an hr\n",
      "These are knock offs off the Apple earbuds. Cheap knockoffs. The plastic earbud portion sounds hollow and cheap, and they stopped working within a month of buying because the wire fractured within the coating after light use. Don’t make my mistake in buying these.\n",
      "sound good, good price\n",
      "Right out of the box, the left side worked.  Don't buy. Defective products.\n",
      "It works great\n",

      "The product quality is good, nice. . .\n",
      "The ones I received were problematic. The right earbud has a loose piece of metal(?) inside so every little move I make, I can hear the little piece of matter rattling inside, which is super annoying. On calls people have a hard time hearing me and I end up having to remove the headphones because of the quality. I would not buy these again.\n",
      "Not good.\n",

      "Love it\n",
      "Excellent product and quick service\n",
      "Volume buttons and mic never worked. Sure the sound is decent but I expected to get headphones with a working mic and buttons!\n",
      "If I could rate less than 1 star I would. I highly doubt that these were the real deal, actual Apple products for a handful of reasons: first off, the sound was just not right. It was tinny and hollow sounding, the way cheap headphones usually sound. I compared them with my roommate's Apple EarPod headphones and the difference was obvious; even she noticed something was up. Even the weight of the headphones was off, and there was a bit of glue near the headphone jack I couldn't quite pick off. The biggest red flag, however, was when I dropped the pair on the floor. They only fell from around 2 1/2 feet off the ground, and yet shattered into pieces, the headphone jack being bent at an angle and ready to snap. I have no doubt if they had fallen from a larger height, the headphone jack would have broken off and gotten stuck in my phone. I've attached some photos for reference. I'm in the process of returning these. Would not buy again or recommend to anyone else to buy.\n",
      "Love them, good quality that’s why they got stolen :|\n",
      "Work just like regular EarPods coming right out of the IPhone box.\n",

      "Broke in a few weeks. Garbage build, not real apple headphones.\n",

      "After using them for two weeks the left ear phone stopped working for no reason. They also feel really cheap so they’re probably fake apple buds.\n",
      "Perfect\n",
      "Got it as a gift, i traveled and gave it to my friend and the mic is not working! The problem that its overseas now >_<\n",
      "Very good product. I like it.\n",
      "So far the earphone work great and I've had little to no problems with them except sometimes they get really staticky for a few seconds and then return to normal.\n",
      "No issues. Perfect condition. Brand new. Glad I got them!\n",
      "They are knockoff Apple Earbuds, so I didn't expect much out of them. At least mine work\n",
      "Fake apple product! Poorly made\n",
      "Had no grip or support to stay in my ear had to send back\n",
      "Good price\n",
      "Broke within first month of owning\n",
      "Very Good!!\n",
      "Fake\n",
      "Great sound, fit in ears is just okay. Great value.\n",
      "Product performs as expected. No problems.\n",
      "Quality as promised\n",
      "Stoped working half an hour after opening the package. DONT BUY.\n",
      "Screw this fake azz product\n",
      "They worked just fine :)\n",
      "I got these in November and I am already having to buy another pair of headphones (definitely not these again) because these broke. Didn't even last 3 months. These headphones are not the same quality as the ones you can buy directly from apple, so don't think that you have found a great deal on the original apple headphones. When I first opened the package, I could immediately tell, they were cheaply made, but I was hoping for the best anyway. Few months later and I can tell you, you are getting what you pay for, and in this case, maybe a little less that what you paid for.\n",
      "Terrible static and need to return them\n",
      "work great hurt me ears tho\n",
      "Right side is not working at all.\n",
      "Poor quality. star to give problems (not responding to volume control) in few days. This product is not genuine. Sorry!\n",
      "Perfect\n",
      "Really cheap knock offs of apple earpods. They certainly aren't the real deal. The sound quality is horrendous, and the middle piece where the microphone goes, split within days. Would NOT buy again.\n",
      "Thought these were the same ear buds that came with my iphone.  Not.  Sound is horrible.  No bass.  Right speaker quit working after 1 week of very limited use.  Realize they are only 10 bucks but I wouldn't take another set for free.\n",
      "Exactly what I wanted\n",
      "The sound quality is what it is for a cheap pair of earbuds. The microphone doesn’t work at all.\n",
      "Love it!\n",
      "The headphones were filthy when they arrived. They had stuff smeared on them and they were also not as advertised with the headphone jack. They have the iPhone power plug type jack. I am very dissatisfied.\n",
      "Within two months both EarPods broke and they keep giving me electric shocks..\n",
      "Earbuds, can’t go wrong with Apple products!!!\n",
      "Broke within 2 days of use\n",
      "Shocked me in the ear and now broken - no sound! Lasted less than 3 weeks!! Very disappointing in Apple, for the quality of these headphones. CRAP.\n",
      "Excellent product. Item arrived quickly too\n",
      "Broke after 2 days so don’t buy these fake ass earbuds\n",
      "After a couple of days only one side of the ear phones worked.\n",
      "They're really good in general, I love them, they're good for what I paid for & also have good audio. Not sure if they original but they look legit. NOTE: If you're not satisfied because they \"are a copy\" don't complain about it, y'all know the original ones are way more expensive & you always  get what you pay for. If you want high quality items, you gotta spend more than just 10 bux, & I believe that's common sense. If it hurts you to spend money then just sit down and accept what you get. Y'all expect too much & for everything to be perfect, nothing in life is fair.\n",
      "Pushing the button to take calls or pass music feels hard...\n",
      "Very first use, person on the other end stated that I sounded like I was inside a fishbowl; that was as good as it got.  There's no imitation for Apple earbuds that cost $30.  Just spring for quality and avoid knockoffs like this one, if quality is ANY issue for you.\n",
      "price is awesome\n",
      "Not authentic\n",
      "You pay for what you get\n",
      "Merchandise was great  price was excellent and the service was very good .\n",
      "Product arrived exactly as described and quickly!\n",
      "Very good quality\n",
      "Horrible.. junk gave them as Christmas gifts and broke immediately.. ver disappointed\n",
      "The remote did not work and the earpod cover came off\n",
      "Great work\n",
      "Better than the one I purchased at BestBuy. With the original case.\n",
      "Awesome nephew loved them\n",
      "This is just what I need. The only change I would do is zipping pocket on the front.\n",
      "Mic is messed up and company wouldn’t help me out\n",
      "The button broke after a week and one earbud stopped shortly after. Waste of money.\n",
      "microphone didn't work\n",
      "I liked the previous mat finish wire from my old pair. This shinny wire which seems: thinner, cheaper, 'kinky-er' (keeping the circular twist of the case).\n",
      "They broke in 2 weeks .\n",
      "The earphones work well however, the microphone is a bit weak where people have trouble hearing me unless I raise the controller to my mouth which makes \"hands free\" an inaccurate feature.\n",
      "Super buenos\n",
      "Just like the ones that came with my iPhone 6. Now if I can keep my cat from chewing them up we will be in good shape.\n",
      "It was defective.\n",
      "Pathetic quality\n",
      "I don’t know if these earphones are the real thing. Uneven sound distribution and the earpiece on the left ear always comes off. I have to use a beanie to keep it in place. I bought these earphones for their portability rather than wearing my $200+ headphones in public.\n",
      "love original apple ear buds! the pause button won’t work but volume works! even with that i’m fully satisfied!\n",
      "15 year old gson very pleased good quality sound.\n",
      "My daughter loves these\n",
      "DO NOT ORDER THESE HEADPHONES. They are cheaply made and easily break. I've ordered at least 4 pairs of these because after about 2 months of careful use they always seem to break in one ear. It drives me crazy and I'm sure it would for you too. I would suggest to invest your money in a better pair of headphones that will last longer, that's a way better deal than paying $80.00 every 8 months.\n",
      "FAKE\n",
      "Authentic.\n",
      "Got these headphones and they don't even work. Never used them once. Right out of the package they were broken. Very disappointed.\n",
      "I was walking to work during my 45 minute commute and the right earpod speaker starts to make a buzzing sound when there should be a deep bass sound.  At this point i realized the right speaker was failing.  I haven't even arrive to work yet- they broke in less than 45 minutes of use.\n",
      "I’ve had these headphones for less than a week and the left ear piece has already gone bad. I take good care of my headphones and wrap them up and store them in my computer case in their own little compartment so I know this isn’t user error.\n",
      "These headphones are compatible with the new iPhone 7 accessories\n",
      "Works as expected, sound is great.\n",
      "Lasted me a total of 4 months...\n",
      "I've bought two earPods from this seller, since EarPods tend to be short-lived. Both started clicking in one ear whenever I moved within one or two weeks. The first pair's audio quality started failing pretty quickly after that, and now whenever I plug them into a device, the volume automatically goes to either mute or full blast without me touching or moving the EarPods at all. The second pair probably won't last much longer either, because it's showing the same warning signs. I won't be buying a third from them.\n",
      "Basically, you get what you pay for. Despite the appearance, these don't feel like Apple EarPods; the play/pause button is harder to press, the sound quality is worse, but they do work with an iPhone 6S. When I tried to use these as a headphone/mic combination for my Skype conference calls, co-workers stated it sounded like I was in a helicopter. So they work fine with the iPhone, but not with non-Apple stuff in my experience. Again, they work fine with the iPhone so I can't really complain about getting a pair of headphones for $10.\n",
      "broke after 2 days already.\n",
      "Only one headphone actually works and even then it has to be angled in a certain way for the one to work.\n",
      "Perfect.\n",
      "Earbuds came on time. They are not good quality, the sound is very low\n",
      "Good earbuds, no issues with them.\n",
      "I got these back in september and I am still using them. I have not had really any problems with them. I have notice one bud go little quite occasionally but I am 90% sure that is due to the adapter I have to use for my phone. The control box works fine, the cable is a nice length, and the earbuds fit nice. Would recommend this to a friend.\n",
      "What the heck, the left earbud doesn’t even work !\n",
      "These are awful headphones. one set broke within a few hours of opening the package. They sound like tin and the jack doesn't even plug in snugly.\n",
      "One speaker went out after a week. \n",
      "Remote’s not working, which kinda sucks but i can live with it.\n",
      "Perfect! It is so nice to have ear buds that work on both sides & aren’t tangled. The sound is wonderful.\n",
      "Worst headphones ever. They stopped working properly after two days. I paid almost 12.00 for headphones that don’t even last. I’m ashamed and I would like a refund.\n",
      "Packaging was the same as when I purchased my I Phone. They work very well so far. Thanks\n",
      "Straight out the box, the left earbud barely plays any sound at all, while the right earbud is fine.  Unbelievable.\n",
      "The mic on the headphones I received does not work, the headphones are brand new and clean but the only downfall for me is the non-working microphone\n",
      "Perfect replacement Apple headphones at a great price. They arrived in perfect condition in Apple packaging and work great.\n",
      "Look good and work well\n",
      "These are cheap ripoffs, don't buy. I could tell immediately they are not apple.\n",
      "Earphones are either broken or just have horrible quality, better off getting a cheap pair somewhere else.\n",
      "Only one head phone worked!\n",
      "I received these headphones and the next day wanted to use to talk on the phone. The other person said it sounded like a had a fan on and it was very loud but I could only hear minor beats.\n",
      "Remote on the buds works but, the sound is sketchy.  You have to turn the earbuds in the actual phone for the sound.  The audio goes in and out like I’ve had them for years.\n",
      "Sooooooo the left earpod works fine but the right doesn’t work at all.\n",
      "Waste of money. The right headphone doesn't work, and the sound is constantly in and out if you slightly touch the wires.\n",
      "I was actually very disappointed. I bought new earphones and in only four days they were already broken. I had used them twice! Please reevaluate the types and quality of products you are selling.\n",
      "Lasted less than two weeks. Left ear no longer works. There is hatred in my heart for these garbage headphones. Pure hatred. They were not abused either. Treated well, built badly.\n",
      "My daughter loves these ear buds and when I ordered her another pair I decided to try them for myself. I have to agree with her. They are comfortable and the sound quality is fantastic.\n",
      "Great headphones. Work very well. Highly reccomended!\n",
      "Horrible\n",
      "fast delivery, work very well with beautiful sound. i'd definitely recommend\n",
      "So far they seem to work but they definitely don't feel like authentic Apple headphones. Weight is different on the piece that goes into the ear, the cable seems thinner / more flimsy.  They seem to work and I'll certainly use them but next time I need a pair may just go straight to the manufacturer.\n",
      "The earpods are authenic and really great. Price is cheap. However the cases of earpods are old and dirty. Anyway, thanks to the shop.\n",
      "These earbuds are just like the ones we usually buy from the store, but less than half the price we pay at the store. Win! They arrived on time and are great. Will definitely purchase again:)\n",
      "The right ear pod does not work.\n",
      "shipped in a timely manner; exactly what I ordered as these earbuds are no longer available through Apple. Unfortunately, the right earbud is dead. No sound at all.\n",
      "cheap\n",
      "Didn’t check reviews first since I expected this to be an Apple product. Inline volume control did not work, did not fit, broke within 15 minutes of wear. DO NOT BUY\n",
      "I bought these earphones December 27 2017and  they worked till now January 20 2018 really sucks the mic never worked and the bottens only work once in awhile and only to turn up the volume and only the right earphone works  I wouldn’t recommend to anyone.\n",
      "I like how the headphones made my music sound clear and crisp\n",
      "Ok with normal listening like music but taking a call made static and popping noises.\n",
      "Fake headphones don’t buy pls\n",
      "Love them\n",
      "DONT BUY THESE\n",
      "They’re fake.\n",
      "Chargers stopped working soon as I plugged it up\n",
      "Good\n",
      "Work perfectly delivered on time\n",
      "Do not buy , there not Apple, left ear piece was broken it was rattling inside,microphone does not work, loss of money and time.\n",
      "I've been needing new earphones for a while ever since my own began to wear out. When I first opened the package for it, they felt unusually lighter than my old Apple earphones. I assumed for a while that maybe it was just my imagination that they didn't feel authentic to me but the sound was fine. However I tried using them while video chatting/calling and all of the people that received my calls said I sounded \"muffled\" and that my voice was intelligible.\n",
      "Awesome. Just like Apple earpods.\n",
      "Bought these headphone 2 seperate times. They have good sound quality but they’re really no sturdy. They break easily after a month\n",
      "These are very good apple headphones. We always like them\n",
      "Simply the best.\n",
      "exactly as advertised\n",
      "These are not Apple headphones. They are cheap knock offs. They come in a real Apple case, but who cares? The sound is terrible, and they break quickly and easily.\n",
      "I've had these for not even a month, and one earbud is already going out.\n",
      "Stopped working by the second week of having them. I paused my music for a brief second and the right ear bud was done. Left ear bud only now works.\n",
      "They fell apart within a month.\n",
      "great product, very good sound quality.\n",
      "The product come with a defective left pod. Be aware.\n",
      "Very good when I'm \n",
      "This is how they arrived.\n",
      "This is FAKE, it is not real apple erbuds.\n",
      "Broke in 2 days unreliable not apple this is false advertising\n",
      "Cool but not good\n",
      "These headphones are either defectove or not original feom apole because the audio is horrible! Super dissapoonted eith this product!\n",
      "Item was broken upon receipt.\n",
      "Item arrived as described. Great product.\n",
      "This is what I ordered. It does what I want, fits the way I want, and in fact, is the same thing as what originally arrived with my iPhone.\n",
      "These are FAKE - do not purchase. Call Amazon customer service and complain. They are a very good looking FAKE but the sound quality is garbage.\n",
      "Product was as described. Fast\n",
      "When I bought this item the jack was too small and didn’t fit into my iPhone 7. Poor product. Will not be buying again .\n",
      "These were terrible. Sound quality was awful and unequal. You’re better off buying from somewhere else.\n",
      "It's fake. Don't buy it It cannot work\n",
      "deceiving title - they are not Apple earbuds and are low quality.\n",
      "Beware these are fake. The build quality doesn’t even feel authentic and the sound quality is nowhere near as good as real EarPods. These sound tinny and the bass is terrible.\n",
      "They are just as described, your standard earbuds for Apple products. They came within a few days in new condition. Very happy.\n",
      "Exactly what I expected\n",
      "Initially it worked good.but after 1 month I found it is not working well.also I found it is broken after using regularly.\n",
      "Better quality ea buds\n",
      "Came as advertised. No complaints\n",
      "Very bad quality I received these headphones and they don’t even work properly when loud noises are near the music cuts like the headphones have a short in them I a very unsatisfied with the product!\n",
      "It’s actually hilarious they asked me to write a review, the left headphone died after about 3 days.\n",
      "Quality is awful, broke in a week.  Nothing like the real deal.\n",
      "i bought these twice and both broke very quickly. The first pair lasted a couple months before the sound went out in one of the earbuds. I figured it was a fluke and purchased another pair, which lost sound in one ear today: 3 weeks.\n",
      "Only one ear bud works\n",
      "Perfect. Original earpods, only problem is that the right earpod won't fit in perfectly and will fall off sometimes, but that's not a big issue.\n",
      "Great price and it works well. Thanks\n",
      "Garbage!!!! I bought these headphones as a gift and I was embarrassed because the left headphone would not work at all. LITERALLY NO SOUND CAN BE HEARD ON THE LEFT HEADPHONE!!! Do yourself a favor and DO NOT BUY THESE USELESS HEADPHONES!!!\n",
      "Everything came as it was supposed to. She loves them!~\n",
      "These cords do not work very well and although it says that they work on apple devices.  They get very hot and take an extremely long time to charge.\n",
      "They came on time, but as soon as I opened them and plugged them in, I noticed that the right speaker was louder than the left.\n",
      "The Headphone Had A Shortage By The Time They Were Delivered\n",
      "The left earbud stopped working in kess than a week.\n",
      "After only 3 months using them one side stopped working out of nowhere, I have had Apple earpods for longer and they last more than that.\n",
      "Good Quality.\n",
      "So I bought these as a replacement for my Apple earbuds that came with my iPhone and had stopped working after about a year and a half of me using them. At first they were great. They arrived on time, had all the right packaging and worked just like my old ones. However within two weeks, one of the earbuds had already split open, something that has never happened to me before with Apple products, and eventually the whole thing stopped working. I have a friend who bought these same ones about a year ago, and hers lasted a while so I’m really disappointed that mine broke within the first couple of weeks. Not sure if it was just mine that had a problem but would not purchase these again.\n",
      "Did not like the product at all.  Very poor sounds quality.  Can't be an apple product at all.\n",
      "You will see me buy more I go throw them like crazy\n",
      "Not an Apple product. Speakers are very low quality and not worth the purchase\n",
      "these are nothing like actual apple headphones. not even close. only gave 1 star because zero wasn’t possible\n",
      "Broke within first week\n",
      "Upon first use the person I was talking to heard a constant knocking sound because of the headphones.\n",
      "Thay had no bass JUNK\n",
      "They don’t seem as loud as Apple headphones but are still decently loud.\n",
      "They work great, same as the ones that came with my iPhone.\n",
      "They broke on the first day\n",
      "The BEST EarPods Yet and  I've found them to last through my 16 yr old dancing daughter.\n",
      "Not real Apple headphones but work just as good at a low price\n",
      "Cheap knock off not Apple as description state . Do not buy unless you want cheap junk.\n",
      "Remote control doesnt work\n",
      "I love apple products\n",
      "They work great.  Bought an extra pair to have on hand.\n",
      "Fake headphones. Do not buy.\n",
      "Work great,\n",
      "sucky quality. broke after 1 day of use\n",
      "I bought these headphones from Amazon and they work flawlessly. Since I have an iphone7 I'm tired of buying USB-C headphone which is expensive. I would highly recommend anyone who has an adapter for their iphone7 to buy these phone because they work the same.\n",
      "Muy bueno\n",
      "These EarPods work great! I recently bought some at the Apple store and lost them a week later. If I had known about this great Amazon buy I would have purchased three of them with the same amount of money I bought the single EarPods at the Apple store. Highly recommend!\n",
      "fits the ear more comfortable\n",

      "High quality for the price.\n",
      "Fake cheap crap\n",
      "Had these before and they lasted for years. Had the originals that came with the phone, but they went through the wash so wanted a replacement. These replacements are not the same. The left ear pod opened and the speaker came out of the case after one day. Don’t buy.\n",
      "The ear pieces fell apart after two days of use. Very disappointed.\n",
      "They broke the second time I ever used them\n",

      "My headphones where broke\n",
      "Bootleg product; not genuine Apple.\n",
      "These only work intermittently through both ear phones. Sometimes it will be both, then one or the other. If I move them around I can get them to work properly, but that is not helpful when I use them while running, which is why I bought them.\n",
      "Was a knock off brand the sound was terrible\n",
      "Headphones broke after one day of regular use.\n",
      "No issues with this device.\n",
      "Was a gift. Works perfectly.\n",
      "I purchased these under the impression that it was a two pack. The first photo advertised that it did come with two and after just misplacing my previous pair, two was exactly what I wanted. I was hoping for a backup pair, and a spare when others wanted to borrow them. I was so disappointed when I opened the package to find one headphone set. I went back to the product info and description and anything mentioning two pairs was no longer there (I triple checked BEFORE I ordered), so I didn’t complain because I had no proof. However, that’s the only reason I purchased these because I had found the same ones for cheaper at a nearby store and had I known I only would be getting one pair, I would’ve bought those instead.\n",
      "They did not work properly.\n",
      "Good\n",
      "Very Good!!\n",
      "These are the real thing and I highly suggest buying these. They are not bad.\n",
      "What a joke.  These are NOT Apple ear buds. I am shocked they are allowed to get away with false advertising.  There is no APPLE symbol on the product and the quality is very poor.  Anyone who has purchased true Apple products before will know these are fake\n",
      "Apple makes horrible, overpriced products. Wires break after a few weeks.\n",

      "classic\n",
      "Daughter wore them the first time we were at a store and she said, \"Mom these headphones are not real Apple. They just fell apart.\" The earbud had literally just fell apart in pieces in the ground. How embarrassing.\n",
      "Idk if they are the real Apple Headphones but so far their good. Only problem is that when I’m over the phone people say it sounds like I’m in a helicopter. LOL\n",
      "Cheap price and good quality\n",
      "sound great and have apple logo but not sure that they are true apple buds...\n",
      "Excellent quality sound with my iPhone. These earpods even improve the horrid speakers on my Toshiba laptop.\n",
      "I bought the headphones july 2017 and by December 2017 the headphones dont work. Terrible product and I wish I could get my money back.\n",
      "The cover of the right earbud came entirely off. Don’t waste your money.\n",
      "I love Apple headphones, these were great. I opened them for two days before I used them and when I finally started school I used them from 1st period until 4th period. I put them in my backpack because we had to change into different clothes and when I went back to get them they were stolen. Great headphones tho (:(\n",
      "THESE ARE NOT REAL!!!! I thought that maybe all the people giving these bad reviews were other people selling these FAKE earbuds and wanted the business. BUT ITS GENUINE. THESE SUCK.\n",

      "this product is not original apple as expected\n",
      "These earphones are glitchy and not of Apple quality...would not recommend\n",
      "This product did not work from day 1.  Only one earbud worked when I took it from the package.  I am kicking myself for not reading the reviews.  They are all true.  This product was defective and was not an Apple product either.  I\n",
      "they broke in less than a week and they don’t sound the same.\n",
      "FAKE- music quality was awful and the buds randomly shocked my ears when I would walk while wearing a winter coat.\n",
      "These earbuds are advertised as if they are actually earbuds made by Apple. Not only was the product falsely advertised, but the product was dirty and used upon initial opening. Horrible and dishonest product, again do not buy.\n",
      "Love it !\n",
      "Fell apart after barely using, mutes my music and won’t let me turn it up. Also has a static noise. Not worth the money.\n",
      "Not a durable pair of headphones.  Dropped my iPhone into my lap with headphones connected and the end that inserts into phone became exposed wire.  I have only used them a couple of times since opening the package.  Disappointed\n",

      "Grand ones them\n",
      "NOT real Apple product\n",
      "Great pair of headsets. Wish they were a bit longer, but no biggie 5/5\n",
      "These are not OEM earpods as implied in description. Apple OEM earphones look identical but sound full and clean. These are similar to the knockoffs presently found in 7/11's etc. They sound awful.\n",
      "It works correctly\n",
      "Works great, wife loves it just like the original...will buy it again, seller was quick to respond...\n",
      "Real Apple ear pods at an excellent price.  They seem to be high quality and I like the way they set in my ear.\n",
      "Lets cut to the chase, I don't like these headphones at all. Defected and non-working headphones\n",
      "I opened mine today and one of the headphone is not working. Unfortunately bought 2, it may look like apple product but it’s not.  will be returning\n",
      "The ear buds provide good sound and fit comfortably.\n",
      "We got these for my son so he could have earbuds with a microphone for his XBox.  They work really well.  He said the bass is awesome.\n",
      "These headphones are exactly as described, Cheaper than in stores, my son loves them.\n",
      "Counterfeit - Not Genuine Apple, as advertised. Broke after a few days. Read the reviews.\n",
      "These are FAKE. And don’t even work.\n",
      "Purchased from seller \"OEM Battery Supply.\"  Appeared to be genuine Apple product and has performed flawlessly.\n",

      "They are great. I love them\n",
      "Works great.\n",
      "It broke and I had to throw it away sadly\n",
      "Nothing beats OEM earpods, except OEM earpods at this price!\n",
      "Cheap knockoffs, the sound quality is poor at best. Bulky and do not sit well in ears. Not worth the purchase. It is a much better move to invest in a pair of REAL Apple Earbuds as opposed to these. DO NOT PURCHASE.\n",
      "Came quick and sounds great.\n",
      "Poor sound quality, ear bud uncomfortable, microphone useless. Do not purchase.\n",
      "THEY SUCK! One of the speakers went out within the first week\n",
      "Can't go wrong with a pair.. Having a second would be nice too.\n",
      "Did not work on iPhone 7\n",
      "Knock-Off Product. Breaks fast & cheaply made. I would highly recommend just going to the Apple Store and getting it yourself (even though it is inconvenient).\n",
      "The sound went out on them in 2 days of use no physical damage or water damage\n",
      "My head phones do not work !\n",
      "Arrived on time and item was as described.\n",
      "These ear phones have great sound. They are one of the few that actaully fit comfortably in my ears. The sound quality is really good. Quick delivery.\n",

      "Not real Apple headphones. Knockoffs\n",

      "Amazing\n",
      "CAME WITH AN EMPTY BOX!!! DO NOT TRUST!!!\n",
      "I normally am willing to give products a chance that are off brand. But I had decided that there are no earbuds that have the quality sound of Apple brand. These do NOT have quality sound and after listening to them for just 5 minutes, my daughter asked if they were used or refurbished. We asked for a refund and got it. I am disappointed that Amazon sells these. At least Amazon honored the refund and paid to have me ship them back.  I plan to try the Sony brand to see how they work.\n",
      "Good earphones expensive though\n",
      "Thanks\n",
      "To me who is loves music and has tried a large variety of earbuds and headphones i can tell you these sound near similar , the bass is a little toned down so for you people who dont like full punchy bass these are right for you\n",
      "It doesn’t work l want to return it to contact with you\n",
      "Received a functional set of headphones. Received exactly what I expected. Received on time. No complaints.\n",
      "GOT HERE AND ONE BUD WAS ALREADY NOT WORKING unacceptable. Then the quality in that bud is low. I would expect more from someone who has such \"amazing\" reviews. Disappointed in the least.\n",
      "These will be rejected by iPhone 8 because they are NOT made by Apple\n",
      "These ear pods arrived in a timely manner in official packaging. Everything is just as it should be. They work great!\n",
      "If you're using these for music, I'd recommend you look for something better. The sound quality is poor, and there are some strange things going on like the left/right channel being reversed which makes me think that the manufacturers don't really care a whole lot about quality. Also, they stopped working after about a month and a half of daily use.\n",
      "One side of one of the sets I ordered doesn’t work ☹.  The other set is fine.\n",
      "Its awesome, Great product\n",
      "Ordered for my grand-daughter for Christmas.  She was very happy.\n",
      "Mine arrived broken -- never heard a single sound out of them. I'm totally disgusted.\n",
      "Fell apart the first day i had these. Returned. I doubt these are authenic apple brand\n",
      "What a waste of money?! I bought these EarPods and it doesn’t even work. So many bad reviews. Can’t imagine what customers have been saying. It’s either used or broken or brand new. I got broken ones they were perfectly fine for 10 minutes until it started to get staticky and after that my music turned off. Never buy from the product again. Buy actual $31.00 EarPods from Apple store or online.\n",
      "Broke a few months in - was still a great earphone while it lasted.\n",
      "This product worked well.\n",
      "love\n",
      "Excelent!\n",
      "they stopped working after 2 weeks\n",
      "They work perfectly\n",
      "Only worked out of one ear right out of the package.\n",
      "Do not buy.\n",
      "Work really well. Good sound.\n",
      "Had to ship it back, wire loose out of the box. One side of speaker and microphone were not working.\n",
      "Fake. Not Apple.\n",
      "Don't but. Less than a week and the damn thing stopped working. I didn't miss use this, just sitting at my desk doing homework and the sound tweaked, and then died on the left side.\n",
      "Just what I thought it was going to be when I ordered these ear pods. Will buy again and competitively priced.\n",
      "These earbuds are functional. My biggest concern is whenever there is static electricity, my ears get a zap. Should I be concerned or is this normal during the winter? Also, the wire is thinner than my other ear buds that came with my phone.\n",
      "Works as expected\n",
      "I had them for only a day and they stopped working do not buy them.\n",
      "Good quality original packaging sound is good\n",
      "These aren't genuine Apple Earbuds, which were what I thought I was paying for (probably should have read reviews first), but in case someone does read this review, they're pretty clearly either super refurbished earbuds or plain knockoffs. Now, that'd probably be fine if they worked well, but the audio quality on them is downright horrible. The sound produced by the earbuds I got were extremely quiet and very very tinny. The closest comparison I have is probably the sound coming from a pair of really bad hands-free audio you get from a pair of bad Bluetooth headphones. Really would recommend you to spend your money elsewhere.\n",
      "Terrible headphones! broke within one day of purchase. VERY mad I wasted my money on this.\n",
      "nice\n",
      "They do not work at all. Would not recommend.\n",
      "Purchased from Veritas cellular LLC. These are actual apple brand EarPods. High quality! I'm very happy with my purchase.\n",
      "Exactly what I needed...\n",
      "Does not work\n",
      "They are very good. I am happy with the acquisition.\n",
      "ok\n",
      "The case is the same, but the earphones themselves are of terrible quality and create static instead of music or audio.\n",
      "Didn't work from the start.\n",
      "When I used both the ear buds and the lighting jacks they did not work with my IPhone 7. Dissapointing.\n",
      "Got these for my husband for Christmas; had some trouble with crackling sounds at first, but these sounds eventually disappeared and earbuds are operating normally.\n",
      "when came they were loose and then broke 2 weeks later\n",
      "The plug has come unglued after only 3 or 4 uses. The wires are much stiffer than on the buds that came with my iphone. I am not sure they are genuine.\n",
      "Giving out after a couple of months.  Apple product?\n",
      "I’m clumsy and tend to drop my headphones a lot, which is the reason I’m constantly buying new ones. With these, I’ve dropped them but they still work flawlessly. It’s a great product.\n",
      "DO NOT BUY THESE\n",
      "Everything was great !!!!!\n",
      "I bought these for myself and kids for Christmas because our other ones all stopped working, and after less than a week the one pair has already stopped working on the right side! Very irritating\n",
      "Not sure where are these bad reviews are coming from but.... Mine was brand new, came in Apple retail packaging. They may be imitation but they perform well. Neat, clean, and amazing sound quality that matched my previous apple headphones which I got from an Apple retailer so. Pretty good in my opinion.\n",
      "Feel the right ear in breaks out sometimes. Other than that great fit and headset works!\n",
      "handy spare set\n",
      "Headphones sound just like regular apple headphones, feel, and look like them. came in the headphone boxing thing, and came clean and new.\n",
      "Remote control didn't work, nor did microphone.\n",
      "The headphones look new but the white material that covers the wire is cracked from poor packaging. In addition, the speakers are broken. The music goes in and out depending on the angle of the cord and are incredibly muffled. These definitely held me over but don't bother wasting the money, they're not worth it.\n",
      "They are as expected. I just didn't realize new headphones now have only the lightning connector for the iPhone, as the new phones no longer have headphone jacks apparently.\n",
      "Perfect Replacement Set of Apple buds...\n",
      "My husband and I always fight over who gets to use these headphones. So much so, that I bought him his own pair for Christmas. I use them for work calls and he uses them to listen to music while working out. They are very versatile.\n",
      "I am not sure these are actually Apple earbuds. If they are, they are defective. The microphone is not clear at all to others; it sounds fuzzy on the other end. When listening to music, sometimes there is no sound for no apparent reason. Wires seem really thin as well and likely to break sooner rather than later.\n",
      "Unfortunately these are marketed as Apple Computer headphones, they are not actual Apple headphones but a very close fake. The packaging and design is identical but you can tell these are a cheaper version\n",
      "The mic is not powerful enough. Every time I try to talk to someone with the headphones they cannot hear me. I think the mic is faulty. The air buds are powerful.\n",
      "They are great!\n",
      "You can realise there are not original just by seen them\n",
      "Do not buy! False advertisement\n",
      "As expected\n",
      "Doesn't fit iPhone 7\n",
      "As described.  Good price\n",
      "Delivered on time and works great.\n",
      "Very low quality sound, awkward feeling in ear with them and cheap buttons make the single week you can keep working a bad time\n",
      "I compared these directly with a pair of Apple earpods and they are not even close in quality. I am quite sure that this is not an Apple product, and equally sure that Amazon knows about this fraud, and doesn't care to address it.\n",
      "It was a gift for my 12 year old grandson.  He was very happy ti receive them.\n",
      "They work really nicely.\n",
      "I am returning this.  Only the left ear bud worked.  My daughter was very disappointed.\n",
      "Original Apple EarPods, decent headphones at a good price. Way better audio quality for the price if you do research, but if you just want the original apple headphones this is it.\n",
      "Awful bought this product and in less of a month the right side has no sound ( I thought it was of how dirty my headphone jack was ) but when I read reviews I was shocked to find that the earphones are fake\n",
      "Sound quality extremely poor sorry that I kept it\n",
      "Excellent product\n",
      "The plastic around the jack melted and quit working within 24 hours of my daughter using them. When she can get them to work only one earbud works.\n",
      "I received this product December 4th and it was less than 2 weeks when the right earbud stopped working.  They worked fine for about a week and the sound was good for 14 dollar ear buds. Unfortunately I am left only listening out of my left ear so in the end I am disappointed with the product I received.\n",
      "Horrible ... fake apple broke in 2 hours.\n"

      "I probably got a defective product because the sound quality was not good. Two months after I got it one of the earbuds went silent. I would not risk buying it from here. Go to the apple store, pay the extra money and test them out while you are there. If they don't work at least you can exchange them at the store.\n",
      "These look and feel comparable to Apple but no logo.  I figured I did not care as long as they worked.  They do not.  The plug is loose and falls out, if I push in really hard it works on my iPhone 6 Plus.  All I get is static on my iPad.  If I could give no stars, I would.\n",

      "They're great! I'm not an apple fan, but I love their headphones because I don't have to worry about losing the rubber protectant thingy. The microphone works great as well, I use it a lot while on the phone because my arm gets tired holding it (I talk on the phone for hours).\n",

      "As soon as I got them the volume button was not working, I would manually have to change the volume and sometimes it would get stuck and raise the volume to the max in the middle of a song. Also It's been less than a week an the left bud has completely stopped working. I am going to contact them for an immediate refund.\n",
      "Horrible, just horrible. I understand that these were just $12.00, but it’s still an apple product. I can buy cheaper earphones for better sound quality than these. The left ear was louder than the right ear. The overall sound was really, really stuffy, as if I had years of ear wax collected inside my ears or something. I am so, so disappointed. If I could, I would give this product a zero-star rating. Do not recommend.\n",
      "I bought this  earphones twice,first it was original second time it was  Chinese fake!\n",
      "Nice\n",
      "These headphones broke the second day I had them\n",
      "Delivered faster than expected and quality is great! Thank you\n",
      "One ear didn't work. Cheaply made.\n",
      "The description is misleading. These are not genuine apple headphones. The sound is a somewhat distorted when listening to music and watching videos.\n",
      "Horrible, Fake knockoffs. the right ear did not work. DO NOT BUY THESE ARE COUNTERFEIT Taiwanese knockoffs. Totally disappointed as to why Amazon would allow these to be passed off as authentic. ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE!!! I will not forget this!\n",
      "Bought from OEM Battery Supply. Fake and used. There was hair in it before I opened it.\n",
      "Audio didn't function correctly and the wire snapped after a very slight pull. When compared to the headphones that came with my iphone they looked slightly different. Fake and poor quality.\n",
      "One of the earbuds does not work ,it stoped working same day that I received them\n",
      "They’re terrible. One ear bud doesn’t work and it started shocking the mess out of me.\n",
      "Came EXACTLY as described andnwork great!! Thank you!!!\n",
      "My right earbud stop working.\n",
      "Very great! Thank you so much. Clear sound, fully functional.\n",
      "FAKED!! If negative stars could be given this product would have earned it.  I'm shocked that Amazon allows knockoff items like this to be sold on their website.  These are junk!  100% not OEM Apple earbuds.  BOOOOO!!!!!\n",
      "I just tried them and its already damaged. what garbage! fake apple of course lol\n",
      "They sound horrible\n",
      "I’ve had these earphones for a little over a month now. Just this week, the left earbud when out while I was working out at the gym. They worked completely fine until this and I barely used them as is. After this, I now question the legitimacy of the product I had purchased. Wouldn’t buy again from here or advise it either.\n",
      "These headphones aren’t actually Apple headphones. Brand new out of the package the play/pause remote didn’t work, and the volume controls only work to turn the volume up, not down.\n",
      "False advertisement is a form of White-Collar Crime. This product is legit horrible and should not be advertised as \"Apple Earphones\" because it is misleading the buyer. Buy beware, the quality is completely trash. Not to mention for about $15 more you can purchase the REAL APPLE Earphones on Apple.com\n",
      "This product bares no Apple trademarks or logos. Unless I'm mistaken, the product is a replica of the Apple Earpod.\n",
      "My daughter loves them\n",
      "Broken before I ever started to use them!\n",
      "These are not made by Apple and have noticeably poorer sound quality than the OEM ones.\n",
      "Definitely not Apple product. Earbuds are terrible and mic doesn’t work... bought three pairs. Each barely work.\n",
      "They legitimately shock the ear of my brother as he listens to music. These are by far and away the most garbage item I've ever bought on this website, and I've placed like 700 orders in the past 3 years.\n",
      "Fake headphones, mic not working\n",
      "Not even real they are so bad\n",
      "I can see now that these are answered in the questions as fake, but these ARE NOT THE ONES IN THE PICTURE!!! There is no Apple sign on the back and it came with two left ear buds. DO NOT BUY!!!!\n",
      "They look like Apple earphones, but Apple they are not. The sound isn't good. I am fine using them to listen to a podcast, using one earbud, but if you're looking for sweet musical sounds with no tinny ringing, you're SOL.\n",
      "I leave these headphones at work, so I rarely use them. However they are already beginning to have issues, like only one side working.\n",
      "This product is fake.  It is NOT an Apple product.\n",
      "Exactly as expected and arrived quickly.\n",
      "You get what you pay for\n",
      "Arrived dirty in a cracked case!!! Not sure these are real.\n",
      "Total garbage, ok folks? These earbuds, and I like earbuds by the way, are just terrible. Did you hear they were good? That was fake news, ok? Fake. News. It's true. These worked until the return date, then stopped working. They don't work. Terrible. THEY SOUNDED GOOD BEFORE THAT! I think it's because of China. It's China, ok? We're losing to China, bigly. The left side? There's no sound at all. None. It's true. And I have the best hearing, by the way. No one has better hearing than I do. I can hear all the things with my left ear. and my right. People come up me all the time and say, Dona... John, John Barron, who you are, and I am by the way... you have the best hearing. And I can hear them. I can hear them so good.\n",
      "they had broke inside my phone\n",
      "This was NOT apple product! But it was packaged in apple box...this is a big scam remove this.\n",
      "Thank you!\n",
      "Garbage.  Crappy knock-off.  Poor audio and fragile as hell.  Not comparable to those from Apple that come with older iPhones.\n",
      "Bought these and recieved them and they worked fine until about a week later,one side is way quiter and you can barely hear out of it\n",
      "I've had these earbuds for about two weeks and already the chord has to be held a certain way for the audio to come through correctly. This was an issue that I noticed immediately when they arrived but slowly got worse and worse and now the headphones are barely functional. I don't know if this was a manufacture error or just a problem with the kind of earbuds but it's not good either way.\n",
      "I love these headphones, but I've had them for a few months and they get a little static sometimes. It could just be from my phone or static electricity or something else, but other than that they are fantastic and I use them everyday.\n",
      "Earbuds work just like the original.\n",
      "lit\n",
      "Excellent product and service!!! Definitely recommend it!\n",
      "good\n",
      "I can tell the difference between these and actual apple earbuds, the sound is good and it fits like apple earbuds it just feels a little different when you put them in your ears they fit the same just what the they are made or threw me off but overall their good earbuds unless your looking for a specific brand get these!\n",
      "good sound\n",
      "Broke the day after I got them very cheap\n",
      "Sound awful DO NOT BUY!! They do NOT deserve 3 stars. Sound horrible compared to real apple earbuds. The #1 Best seller tag is such a scam. Do not be fooled...\n",
      "Ear phones do not work properly.\n",
      "It is a great product thank you...\n",
      "As soon as I took these out of the box, I could tell that they were not real Apple EarPods. The wire felt different, the buttons click much louder, and they lack the very good sound quality of real Apple ones. Now, i decided I would keep them as a spare, and buy a real Apple pair from Walmart the next day.\n",
      "awful.\n",
      "Worst purchase poor quality, unable to speak  through without poor connection\n",
      "I got them with one side blown out. Isn’t as loud as I wanted them to. The volume/pause button on it doesn’t work. Questioning if these are the real apple brand earbuds\n",
      "They can call these Apple earphones all they want, but they are clearly knock off or refurbished. There was dried glue on the ear buds. Cord is crap. Has tons of kinks already. Microphone does not work at all so don’t purchase if you ever use your headphones to make phone calls.\n",
      "Very staticy and shocked my ears a couple times. Obviously fake.\n",
      "do not buy this, the earphones are not Apple brand, the box does not have the Apple logo, they are generic earphones, you will not receive what is shown in the photograph.\n",
      "Fake. But still work like real ones.\n",
      "I have ordered two because it looked nice and w once they came in one did not work do not but this\n",
      "I purchased these for my 66 year old mother-in-law. They broke after two uses (the right ear bud doesn't put out sound). Extremely disappointed. I will not purchase these/from this seller again. BOO.\n",
      "Order came in timely manner and good price for Apple brand headphones\n",
      "These are definitely fake. The sound is uneven between the two earbuds and they are even visibly different than authentic Apple headphones. The case they came in doesn't even have the Apple logo on them. The sound also gets scratchy if you're walking around while using them.\n",
      "They already broke! What the heck!! I don't treat them badly, I don't throw them around or rip the out of the audio jack. I am really disappointed.\n",
      "The microphone did not work and the earbuds sounded funny.  Would not recommend\n",
      "Had them for 4 days and they don’t work already but to mention the feast that I ordered two and got one\n",
      "One earbud broke apart as I went to use it for the first time - apparently the earpiece wasn't glued together properly. Sound was more of an issue though, as friends reported a constant buzzing/humming sound in the background during conversations. I threw them away and just ordered the Apple version - penny wise, dollar foolish.\n",
      "I am very pleased with my daughter's headphones. For such low price, I was expecting them to work less than perfect, but the clearity is awesome.\n",
      "I have purchased lots of earbuds over the years...including one set purchased on Amazon that costs around 100 bucks.  I happened to use my daughter's new Apple earbuds and was impressed with their perfect sound for audiobooks and the fact that they do not use those very nice but easy to lose silicone rubber ear inserts.\n",
      "I ordered me and my mom a pair. It came with packaging exactly like Apple’s but right away I noticed no Apple logo on the back. Took them out, seemed fine. Worked fine. But I could still tell there just not Apple.\n",
      "Just bought these. The volume button doesn’t work, right out of the box\n",
      "Ummm my volume won't work should I return?\n",
      "Came with a bent audio jack and one earbud doesn’t work...\n",
      "Came broken which I was very upset about.\n",
      "not real apple ear phones. broke immediately\n",
      "These are not Apple brand\n",
      "This product did not work. The earphones showed up defective, the right ear did not have sound.  These products also while they come in \"apple\" packaging it is not actual \"apple\" headphones. I am inclined to believe this is a scam.\n",
      "I was excited when I first got these.  The description said #1 Best Seller, so I was encouraged when the price dropped.  Now I know why...the sound quality is terrible.  They look just like the Apple product, but they definitely are not Apple quality.  Just moving around I was getting static noises in my ear, not a fan!\n",
      "Awesome exactly what I wanted. Arrived early and works great my kids love them. Can't say enough good things about this product thank you.\n",
      "Definitely a knock off version, BUT they seem to work okay.  The remote seems a bit different than the original, but it works, so I suppose that's what matters.  Sound is decent and fit is just as expected.\n",
      "These are definitely not authentic Apple EarPods. I bought two sets of these earphones and everything from the wire material to the inline mic/remote assembly felt very cheap. They were of such poor quality that they both broke within a week. Hard Pass\n",
      "Great sound, good quality.\n",
      "Very poor earphones. I thought it\\s Genuine Apple Earphones but it's not, in fact is just a garbage looks like an earphones.\n",
      "Work perfectly w my iPhone\n",
      "Unfortunately, these only lasted a week and one of the earbuds stopped working.\n",
      "Great !!!\n",
      "Absolutely AWFUL! There’s no way these are real Apple headphones. Less than a week and they’ve already stopped working. The material of them doesn’t feel like legitimate Apple headphones either. Do not waste your money.\n",
      "There is static in earphone while talking over call.\n",
      "It’s already broken already without even being used for a week\n",
      "One earphine broke after week\n",
      "I wanted a few spare sets of these earphones for both automobiles.  They arrived perfectly packaged and are just want I desire.  Nice, comfortable fit with an in-line volume control.\n",
      "Fake Headphone, Easy Broken in 1 week, When get smash every part will separate\n",
      "everything works except for the microphone. When talking on the phone the sound is inauable\n",
      "I'm good at taking care of my headphones but I'm also clumsy so they always last me five or six months which is good! Just make sure you buy from a seller with good reviews!\n",
      "Works great!\n",
      "The real deal\n",
      "Very nice\n",
      "Button stopped working after 2 weeks. Sound is ok\n",
      "They work but don't be fooled by the packaging.  They are NOT apple headphones.  The sound is very tinny and the volume up/down buttons don't work.  Don't buy them.\n",
      "These are not genuine Apple Earpods.\n",
      "They work good and look good. Can sound a bit staticky depending on what I’m listening to.\n",
      "Microphone quality so poor that it won't correctly type my talk-to-text words. Useless for making voice recordings; sound too low. The material is stiff, nothing like the apple buds that came with my iPhone. Returning.\n",
      "The volume button on the earphones won't work but other than that they are fine\n",
      "The area where you control volume broke apart less than two weeks if simple use.\n",
      "Thanks you\n",
      "They Went out 2 weeks later\n",
      "Volume and play/pause button broke within three days of receiving this. Left earbud has broken after not even two weeks of use. Obviously not the standard quality of \"apple\" earbuds.\n",
      "great!\n",
      "These are not Apple certified headphones. The sound is okay in them; however, the microphone does not work. False advertising on behalf of Amazon.\n",
      "Repackaged garbage. These are ALL complete junk!\n",
      "Great juts as advertised\n",
      "Great headphones. though the first pack of headphone werent uo to my standards, the company sent me an email for a replacement!!! very nice!!! 10/10\n",
      "I received the headphones. And only one work  can you please send another ?\n",
      "came broken.\n",
      "The headphones I received were likely not new as advertised; didn't work perfectly - some static comes through.\n",
      "These are not Apple headphones. Terrible quality audio. They look just like Apple headphones, but are no where near the quality. I will be returning.\n",
      "DO NOT BUY. I keep getting electric shocks in my ears when using them. I've had them for a few hours. It's very annoying and I really regret this purchase.\n",
      "We received the product in a timely manner and the headphones work.\n",
      "does not work well with the iphone.\n",
      "Not very good sound quality and very flimsy- I don’t think I had them for even a week before they broke.\n",
      "Wire frayed within 3 days DO NOT BUY\n",
      "These ARE NOT real Apple headphones. They feel different (the wiring is more stiff, the white part not as smooth) and the sound quality isn't as good. There is a crimp in the right earpiece wire that I expect to affect performance down the line.\n",
      "The price was great and I received this item within a week!\n",
      "These earbuds stopped working properly 3 weeks after I received them. Only one earbud plays sound and the control buttons do not work. I emailed the seller but did not get any response. Complete waste of money. My previous apple earbuds lasted over 2 years.\n",
      "Everything is OK. Recommended.\n",
      "Um right when I opened the package and used them they didn’t work sooooooooo fix yo stuff cause they suck\n",
      "This is a counterfeit product. Not genuine Apple earbuds. Sound quality is really bad and the build quality is low.\n",
      "They work fine for listening, but the mic was defective\n",
      "Not original, quality of audio substandard. Tooke forever to arrive.....\n",
      "Amazingggggf!\n",
      "Definitely not an Apple product. False advertising. Compared them to a legitimate pair of apple earphones and the quality is nowhere near. Almost no bass, they sound hollow. Very disappointed.\n",
      "Very comfortable, good sound quality, awesome price. The volume buttons don't work in Android, but these earbuds are very good. I recommend them.\n",
      "Purchased 2 pair thinking they were like Apple original equipment, they are junk. NOT HAPPY!\n",
      "not bad\n",
      "These broke within a few weeks of use...waste of money\n",
      "The product doesn't seem to be a real apple Earphones.. The buttons for the volume are both not working properly. Once in a while it would work.\n",
      "These headphones were staticky they started to hurt my ear because of all the static. I recommend just buying these headphone phone from apple or best buy.\n",
      "Took headphones to Apple store said they are not a genuine Apple product in other words bootleg\n",
      "These aren't real apple earphones. Knock-off.\n",
      "One ear pod no longer works.  I only had them for about 5 weeks.  Very disappointed.  Not sure how I can return them for a refund.\n",
      "I love the packaging and how they came. I have used them a few times and can't really complain\n",
      "These say they are \"Apple\" headphons but they are not. When you open the package you can tell they are a cheap knockoff. The first few weeks they worked ok. Then one of the ear peices fell apart. And now that earbud doesn't play any sound.  For this price, I would expect them to work for more than 1 month.  Can I get a refund?\n",
      "Highest volume is not very loud. Hardly any base. I thought these were the Apple earphones u get when u get a new iPhone.  NOT EVEN CLOSE!\n",
      "Gift\n",
      "Volume button only turns down not up at all and the left earpiece stopped working afte 5 days, not happy with this product at all\n",
      "Great buy\n",
      "Product was as described and shipping was timely.\n",
      "Over the last 4 years I have used 3-4 different earphones, where only the first pair was an original Apple product. I have to say, this one was by far the WORST. DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK OF A PRODUCT. Here is why:\n",
      "works just like our other apple earphones (that my teenager destroys a set per year.)\n",
      "Great sound.\n",
      "Absolute garbage. Actually worse than garbage calling it garbage is an insult to garbage.\n",
      "When I recieved, they were not in an Apple package. After one week of using them the pause/play button snapped. These seem to be a knock off and do not hold up to the quality of product I expect from Apple.\n",
      "one earbud never worked....\n",
      "Earphones stopped working after a week.  Trash.\n",
      "horrible headphones,  only one headphone worked !! don't buy there 100% fake\n",
      "Was sent uses garbage.\n",
      "They were exactly what I asked for.\n",
      "not working after one month.\n",
      "Work great\n",
      "Good quality sound\n",
      "As the other reviewers say, these headphones are not the actual Apple headphones they purport themselves to be. They're a cheap knockoff that has zero bass and not much more than that.  Total scam.\n",
      "The original Apple headphones but the sound doesn't seem to be as loud as the last pair\n",
      "The right earbud stopped working after a week of use. Don't buy these, just spend the money on real ones.\n",
      "Horrible product\n",
      "Price/Performance is great\n",
      "Fast and accurate.\n",
      "These are a horrible do not waste your money on these. They fell apart in a week and sounded horrible. Please please please don't waste your money.\n",
      "These don’t sound nothing like the ones that come with iPhones. The seals around the speakers themselfs aren’t properly placed so the left ear bud isn’t as loud as the other one. Trash. Will not buy these again\n",
      "I should have read the reviews before hand. The bass sucks the treble sucks the medium sucks. THE BUTTONS DONT WORK!!!!. Fake headphones. Sounds tiny. The material is even garbage. They are good for one thing though... FOR WASTING YOUR MONEY!!!\n",
      "Not an authentic Apple product, I ordered these to replace my broken Apple headphones and everything seemed fine until I started listening to music through them. The terrible sound quality was noticeable immediately and only then did I notice these have no Apple marking on the back of the case like they show in the picture. Will be returning!\n",
      "Music only plays through the right earbud.\n",
      "Received it properly, was in great condition\n",
      "Perfect condition and work well\n",
      "Absolutely aweful quality. They make it sound like I’m listening under water.\n",
      "We returned these earphones the day after we received them. The image shows an Apple logo on the box, but these area not Apple earphones and the Apple logo does not appear on the box that we received. The box and earphones felt cheap. The cord had a short the first time we used them and the sound did not come through both sides. These are earphones are not worth the time or money. Seeing all the other negative reviews, I am disappointed that Amazon continues to mark them as a \"Amazon's Choice\" item.\n",
      "The headphones I purchased were unfortunately delivered damaged. The headphones worked fine for listening, but the microphone was damaged and caused a distorted sound when trying to talk on the phone.\n",
      "These earbuds were exactly what I expected. I couldn’t ask for better if I ordered them directly from Apple\n",
      "I personally will always love apple headphones but I’m getting AirPods soon but if I’m going traveling I think I would buy another pair so my AirPods don’t get stolen or lost but they are very durable earbuds non the less. Would recommend to anyone who likes music and wants the best quality sound for the money.\n",
      "These do not sound like apple earbuds. Must be knockoff. Buyer beware\n",
      "Arrived quickly and in original packaging.\n",
      "well my daughter bought them for my sons birthday. they DID NOT WORK. We hooked them up to several different devices and at best one side would try to work. But they are garbage. and NOT REAL IPHONE\n",
      "Very bad quality. Stopped working two days after I got it.\n",
      "THESE SPARKED INSIDE MY EARS IT REALLY HURT\n",
      "The pair of earphones I received were fake\n",
      "Hardly work and fell apart within a week\n",
      "I plugged in these headphones and borrowed my friends’s headphones to see the difference and these sounded horrible. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY.\n",

      "Right ear bud goes in and out!  Not working correctly!\n",
      "Same as the original, low price and good quality.\n",

      "Caused lot of interference when used with iphone6.\n",
      "Trying to find some Apple Earbuds but keep coming across copies that won’t work the same. I immediately noticed a sound issue with the ear buds and within a couple times of use the left bud stopped working. Requested a refund and returning this item.\n",
      "Came broken. DO NOT buy this garbage\n",
      "These are cheap knock-offs.  Not real Apple Earphones.  Totally misrepresented. I tried using them for a call and my workmate said it sounded like I was at the far end of a tunnel.  Garbage.\n",
      "The second I used it the hearing was unbalanced and it did that thing when you move around the headphone jack, the sounds would go in and out. It is really a hit or miss with these headphones. P​robably not the real deal\n",
      "These arrived in an opened, non-branded case (no Apple logo).\n",
      "not fake product\n",
      "I have bought four of these this year. They are worthless crap and keep breaking. This pair lasted less than two months.\n",
      "Used and not Apple as advertised. They were dirty.\n",
      "They work, volume and mic don’t function. Guess that’s better than two right earbuds though lol. Don’t buy these, I also thought they were Apple and they were inexpensive because of the new wireless ones. Wrong wrong wrong wrong...wrong wrong wrong wrong...wronggggg!...wrongggg!!!\n",
      "Broke within 3 weeks\n",
      "These headphones don't work completely. Only one side works.\n",
      "great earbuds\n",
      "Excellent service and great product\n",
      "Disappointed.  I kept them because my kids needed a pair but I can't use these.  The sound quality is off and so is the quality of the microphone.\n",
      "Love apple earphones.\n",
      "Didn't feel like the headphones you get with your iPhone products, to begin with, and the head covering the part that goes into the ear broke off after a few days after receiving the product.\n",
      "THESE ARE NOT AUTHENTIC APPLE EARPODS!!!!!!! DO NOT BUY THEM!!!!!!! It is false advertising. I was excited thinking that I found Apple EarPods for $14, BUT THEY ARE NOT REAL APPLE EARPODS. It's BS.\n",
      "I am not an Ipone user. I tried out the Iphne 7 and I really like the ear pods that came with it. I wanted a set with 3.5 mm headphone jack to use with other phones and devises. I like them a lot!\n",
      "Okay, first thing I noticed the sound was terrible. Wasn’t expecting Harman Kardon, but I can tell you Bruce Springsteen sounded like he was singing out of little tin cans in my ears. Fell asleep with them in and woke up and a bud was snapped in half! I am not a large person, my husband says I don’t mosh in my sleep, so WHY was this broken. Not even worth the postage to return them what a scam.\n",
      "These are not apple headphones\n",
      "The microphone and right headphone doesn't seem to be workin g properly.  Callers hear static and the right headphone is more quiet than the other.\n",
      "Within the first week after I got these headphones, one side stopped working.  I like this style and didn’t even buy cheaper imitation headphones. I expected them to work longer than a week.\n",
      "Ordered two pairs, one for home and one for school. The microphone broke in one already, and now the one of the speakers broke in the other. And of course, it is just past the return window.\n",
      "Fake!\n",
      "sound quality is crap. it doesn’t sound good at all.\n",

      "Great Product and service\n",
      "I’m on a treadmill as I type this. These continuously fall out when you’re doing anything active. These headphones are only to be used while sitting down when listening to music. I’d rather run without music than attempt to reposition them in my ear every ten seconds. They should ONLY be used as a backup. I’d never purchase these alone. I only use the pair that come free with an iPhone. With all that said, an extra star (2 from 1) for decent audio quality and appearance.\n",
      "Ieakage of electricity, the worst thing which i purchased on amazon!\n",
      "Sound was fine. However, the microphone was terrible.\n",
      "I bought this expecting them to be new, but instead they arrived very apparently used. The casing has multiple apparent damages and the earphones themselves have scratches. Shouldn’t be labeled “new” with the condition they arrived in...\n",
      "the microphone doesn't work on the headphones \n",
      "Single ear broke in less than 30 days and they wont do anything about it... The other one works, as does the remote which is on the same wire as the broken ear bud.\n",
      "Works perfectly. No issues at all.\n",
      "new earphones in apple packaging\n",
      "Worst headphones ever!! I may as well went to the apple store. The headphones are poor quality. I can only hear sound from the left one, and it’s loaded with static. Callers can not hear me when I speak, and each time I moved, the wires makes a lot of static sound..\n",
      "The case it comes with is clearly a used one and only one of the earbuds worked and the one that did was horrible sound quality the volume changer didn’t even click. dont be dumb like me and get this one. DONT GET IT!!!!\n",
      "These arrived quickly and in the Apple packaging. Work great.\n",
      "It’s been less than a day and already the right earbud doesn’t work anymore. And the little remote doesn’t work half the time. Just go out and buy some\n",
      "Do not buy complete false advertisement the pictures show the Apple icon logo stamped in the back of the case in the photos when you receive that is not the case it's a piece of cheap computer paper with a partially printed barcode on it these are not authentic iPhone earbuds or Apple earbuds\n",
      "These are not Apple headphones. They are fine for the price but definitely not made by Apple\n",
      "The headphones I got are supposed to be apple originals, they sound worse than the dollar store brand!!! I had bought this item many times before with no issue, but this set of two I bought are blown!! They sound like crickets in there sound horrible and the volume just hurts your ears is such a loud pitch!!!\n",
      "Awful purchase, The microphone and buttons do not work on these earphones!\n",
      "These headphone are NOT Apple headphones and they are NOT compatible with iphones-the volume button does not work, nor does the microphone.  The quality is beyond cheap.  I am so disappointed.\n",
      "They suck one of my ear buds don't even work!!!\n",
      "Great quality for the price. My daughter absolutely loves them\n",
      "This is not authentic apple ear pods.\n",
      "Only works on some occasions, have to move cord around at times to make them work properly.\n",
      "NOT a authentic product! This is misleading which should be addressed by Amazon. I got this as a gift, I could clearly see the difference in quality between the real Apple ones and these. The sound was horrible and the mic did not work at all, after three days no sound at all and i threw it in the trash. DO NOT BUY!\n",
      "2 days after receiving, one side of EarPods stopped working. As my asian friend once told me\" Good ting no cheap, cheap ting no good\"\n",
      "Not the one which I bought earlier with the same seller.\n",
      "They arrived on time, well packaged. No issues...worked right out of the box. Thanks!\n",
      "Didn't break good sound\n",
      "DO NOT BUY! After about 3 days of regular usage the left earpod stopped working.\n",
      "great ear phones\n",
      "Very Good quality and works perfect with iPhone 8 , Belkin 3.5 mm Audio + Charge RockStar.\n",
      "If you are latex sensitive these are ear phones to get!. They don’t have latex coverings....they are all plastic!\n",
      "great\n",
      "Fake expensive rip what else you need to know\n",
      "Wouldn’t buy again\n",
      "Shipping too long,it isn't have a quality as a real earphone from Apple,if you turn your max volume,you can hear the sound outside. The micro is weak and easy to broken. But it works still good.\n",
      "These are not authentic apple headphones. The headphone control is too thick and the sound is very different as well. The material also feels different. Not happy with my purchase. I thought I was gonna get authentic apple headphones.\n",
      "As many others have mentioned, these are not real Apple earphones, and I noticed immediately by the quality of the sound. Don't waste the time to have to return them.\n",
      "Great design and fit.\n",
      "I received a fake pair of headphones. There was no Apple logo anywhere on the box and the item appears to have been repackaged as new.\n",
      "DO NOT BUY. Not worth more than $5. These are the worst pair of headphones I have ever purchased. I've bought many off-brand Apple-style earbuds from many sellers in the past and they have been decent, but this was by far the worst pair I have ever owned.\n",
      "Knock off ,\n",
      "These are fake! Audio quality is awful. Completely fake! Do not buy! Worst headphones ever! Very disappointed.\n",
      "These are not OEM Apple earphones and sound like complete crap!!!!! If I wanted crap I couldve purchased this quality for a hell of a lot cheaper on eBay.\n",
      "Opened it from the package and the left ear bud did not work. Second pair in a row I bought from them and they both did not work. DO NOT BUY THESE.\n",
      "Not actual Apple earphones, but similar. Good for the price but sound quality not as good as actual Apple earphones.\n",
      "Purchased 2 sets of headphones and both are used.  1 of them doesn’t even work.\n",
      "these suck. i got mine and only one of the ear buds works. don't waste your money.\n",
      "All the reviews are telling you these are fake. You’re thinking, “But they look right and the price is good so I’ll give them a chance.”  Bad idea. They really are fake.\n",
      "Second time buying this product and to be honest getting tired of it. Whoever sends these headphones needs to make sure they work properly. Both times had only one side working, and I'm getting annoyed because I've wasted 13 dollars both times.\n",
      "Plugged them in my phone and already one side dosent work.  Garbage not worth the 12 bucks\n",
      "bad quality. appear to be Apple brand but when you receive the package it is clear that they are not. They are made of cheap material, the microphone and volume controller buttons do not work, and sound is fuzzy. Irresponsible on behalf of Amazon for allowing a company to scam consumers by saying it is from \"APPLE\" when clearly it is fake.\n",
      "These are not real apple headphones. They are terrible.\n",
      "Those headphones isn’t working at , I WOULD LIKE A REFUND!!!\n",
      "These sound great. I don't know what everyone is complaining about. These are nearly as good as the real thing. I don't think they are real, but they are 12 dollars folks.\n",
      "They work great matter in fact I’m using them right now  don’t know why everyone saying that they’re fake there hundred percent real Apple ear pods I would definitely recommend getting\n",
      "it was not the originals\n",
      "These were garbage.\n",
      "Had these headphones for a few days and the face of the volume buttons just fell off. Eyes exposed and it will not snap back in. Disappointed.\n",
      "one of which do not have sounds, I have to return it and pay the extra ship fee.\n",
      "Sound on these are great and pretty durable.\n",
      "These are not real apple headphones as described. The photos are misleading and the headphones sound horrible.\n",
      "Work beautifully. Had them a month or so with no issues\n",
      "The plastic case arrived cracked, and the inner part of it wasn't glued/sealed to the outer part of the case. The headphones functioned as expected for listening, which is how it earns two fo the five stars. The microphone, however, produced a screeching sound when used with my iPhone 6 Plus, and when connected to my MacBook Pro the microphone cut out and stopped working entirely.\n",
      "Terrible. Sounds like I’m listening to podcasts at the bottom of the ocean.\n",
      "Their not the real Apple EarPods. They came in a fake Headphone case doesn’t have Apple Logo.\n",
      "Sound quality is weird like it missing something and they aren't authentic or anything.  all the other 1 star reviews are telling the truth\n",
      "This item is not apple. It came in a cracked case, the mic and volume controls do not work, and one earbud is half as loud as the other.\n",
      "Advertised as Apple, but fakes. Quality is not as good as the Apple earphones I've had to buy countless times from Best Buy for $30.  Was suspect of the cheaper price, definitely not genuine Apple product. Sound not as clear, buttons harder to push... definitely not the same.  False advertising, these should be removed for fraud.\n",
      "Volumen button doesnt work!\n",
      "Fake\n",
      "It’s not the real thing. I bought these expecting them to be actual apple headphones, and I received something that LOOKS like them, but sounds and feels completely different. I don’t know why I expected to receive actual apple headphones for 6 bucks, that was probably a little bit foolish, but still. This is false advertising. Also, I’m not completely sure if these have been used or not.\n",
      "Perfect!!\n",
      "Not authentic!\n",
      "perfect.\n",
      "Broke in 1 week. Absolutely do NOT recommend. Extremely low quality rip off.\n",
      "Works great like oem ones\n",
      "Don’t waste your time\n",
      "These headphones are cheaply made and do not work well!  The microphone barely works and I have to yell for anyone to hear me while talking.  I will be getting a refund for this faulty product!!\n",
      "Idk what the bad reviews are about or maybe I got lucky but these work fine I see some pretty bad reviews don't let them change your mind because I have the fit about a week and they are working like they should, Their not real Apple which my first reason for buying them I figured were but besides that they're fine quality us good to me.\n",
      "Horrible! Purchased for use with iphone 6s and the Mic doesn't seem to work properly. The earpiece comes apart every now and again. This has been a disappointment.\n",
      "The box for head phone broke when I open the package. I started open to use it when I flew to Taipei. The sound is really bad. You can tell it is fake Apple. The plastic covers the wire is so different from the original cable that I had.\n",
      "Just ordered these and got them in the mail all three of them have horrible sound and static mic issue don't buy piece of sh*T PRODUCT.\n",
      "I bought these for my niece as a present. She really like them and gave them a thumbs up.\n",
      "The looked and felt fake. Even the package. There was a photo copied sticker on it. No apple logo. No wonder why it was so cheap.\n",
      "I got these because my old earphones were starting to get worn. Terrible tin-sounding treble heavy instead of the amazing clear sound and full bass of my previous pair. I tried two pairs...both were bad, so I doubt I‎t was just a one-off defect.\n",
      "The product appears to be fake, not from Apple. It is of low quality. I do not recommend buying it.\n",
      "One bud mute.\n",
      "I just plugged them in and my right ear bud will not play, but the left one is fine.\n",
      "These are fake, don't work.\n",
      "Exact OEM product.\n",
      "These are the fake ones, sounds like trash. Im real..i lived through this pain\n",
      "I've used the Apple earbuds well for well over 3 years now, and I was always a fan of the sound quality. I've owned probably 9 out so passive if them in that time, but when I got these, the sound quality was just trash. I know what the product should sound like, and this is certainly not it. While the earbuds do function, they have very little bass to speak of, and are easily outclassed by an 8 dollar pair of gummy earbuds.\n",
      "Was not Apple headphones gave me some Walmart product  very in happy\n",
      "Fake. These cheap fakes are selling for $3. Sound tinny. Fake.\n",
      "These are NOT Apple Earphones. These are garbage Chinese knockoffs placed inside an official-looking Apple EarPod case. I bought these to replace my old ACTUAL AND REAL Apple EarPods, so I'll tell you the few things that let me know inside 20 minutes of use that these things weren't the real deal and a waste of money.\n",
      "Broken. Both pairs of headphones are broken. I love apple headphones but these don't work.\n",
      "Very bad quality!!!\n",
      "My son says that these earpieces have not a lot of bass but real clear trouble\n",
      "Misleading. Not Apple or are they new. Mine came with noticeable DIRT on them. Gross.\n",
      "Mic doesn't work. Disappointed.\n",
      "NOT Apple!\n",
      "Do not buy them!!!! They're fake. The one I got the left side didn't even work!!! Don't waste ur money on these. Just awful!!!! Doesn't deserve even a star.\n",
      "Not sure if these are genuine, as the package does there is no apple logo anywhere on the package. The product definitely not the same quality as the original.  The title says \"Apple Earphone\", but they are not authentic.  There is a sucker for everyone.\n",
      "Fell apart at first use\n",
      "These earbuds are knock offs!!!! Do not buy them. The ear bud cords were different lengths and they looked very cheap.\n",
      "Not even close to apple headphones. Pissed I just wasted 8 dollars on this piece of shit\n",
      "excellent service very happy\n",
      "I got this for my girlfriend. She face timed me and I noticed a buzzing sound. We troubleshooted a bit and noticed it was coming from her side. They work but they are not that great. Maybe it is just a defected pair.\n",
      "Only work out of one ear unless held in the right position. Returning.\n",
      "Perfect\n",
      "Description says by Apple and they are fake lookalike crap.amazon should pay more attention\n",
      "They are awesome! Thank you!\n",
      "The earbuds seemed fine until I tried to talk to friends and family using the speaker. It appeared to be faulty, as no one could hear me.\n",
      "Great product, great transaction,fast delivery, product matched description\n",
      "These are indeed fake.\n",
      "If these were made by Apple, they must be rejects or discard or something--definitely not authentic Apple.  Clearly fraudulent use of Apple's trademarking.  What's worse is the pair I got appeared to have been used quite a bit--they were sort of carefully wrapped in the original package, but it was scratched and scuffed and the + and - labels on the volume control were considerably faded from wear.\n",
      "horrible. do not buy this product.\n",
      "One of the earbuds didn't work and just made a static sound.\n",
      "Only One Earbud Works\n",
      "Fake!!!\n",
      "The sound  quality is great\n",
      "I think this is fake because the weight and the touch feeling is not as good as I bought in app store but it is better than others\n",
      "Poor quality.  Not Apple.\n",
      "They look and feel exactly like apple earpods. They sound like the free ones handed out on airplanes and in hotel gyms that you throw away after a use or two. The mic also doesn't work well... people on calls are always asking me to speak louder. I'll be returning these.\n",
      "Good\n",
      "Good product.\n",
      "The sound quality is atrocious, when I got them the case was crushed in and the volume button was almost completely off, however I was able to press it back into place. They have a very cheap feel to them, and I can say for certain they are definitely not apple earbuds. It baffles me how these havent been taken off the website yet.\n",
      "Bad, bad, bad. Nothing more\n",
      "Don’t let the cheap price fool you into buying this. These are NOT Apple products. It’s a scam.\n",
      "Really, really awful. I had them for  3 days with spotty sound before one ear finally went out completely. The sound is tinny and lame.\n",
      "Perfect for my daughters needs\n",
      "did not work at all....only one audio channel works...the control volume doesn't work at all....came more than used. Unfortunately the time i received it I was at the hospital plus rehab time so I couldn't return this\n",
      "Only one side of the headphone worked\n",
      "These are terrible. Have only had several days and they've come apart. Sending back.\n",
      "They work like they’re supposed to.\n",
      "Fake, not a apple product\n",
      "Great\n",
      "these are not original apple headphones.  They produce a static on conference calls.  The wires are stiffer than the apple version.  Can I return these?\n",
      "I was even real careful with the headphone volume control and everything and the volume control ended up with a short in it already and I didn’t even have them a month Which is pretty unusual because I owned a previous pair and they lasted quite a while and were good quality so unless I just ended up with a bad pair I’m surprised the volume control ended up with a short in it already\n",
      "i received these and one of the earbuds were broke\n",
      "Fake and really poor quality.\n",
      "I would rate it 0 if I could! These break instantly. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!\n",
      "These are not the original ones! They give me the earphones of the iPhone 4\n",
      "They look used. Had to wipe them down with alcohol wipes because there was.. stuff on the ear buds. But they are Apple head phones and work great!\n",
      "they work; but they sound quality really sucks lol.\n",
      "Wires were sticking out of the ear phones. Other than that they were as to be expected\n",
      "Great product. Works perfectly\n",
      "These things are garbage.  They last 60 days then fall apart.  I bought several of them for my family and they all started failing.  Wiring shorts out mostly near the connection to the phone.  Trash.\n",
      "Work as described\n",
      "Absolute junk which may last 5 minutes. Don’t waste your time nor money on this below par product.\n",
      "Great product, works well and was delivered on time.\n",
      "These headphones have definitely been used for a while because the microphone doesn’t work with pausing music or turning the volume up and down. You have to have the wire in a certain position to be able to hear the music and the left ear is going out.\n",
      "Never order again.  FAKE and already broke!!\n",
      "These headphones are awesome\n",
      "I don’t know if these are really Apple. The sound isn’t clear, they look old and beat up...and there’s wires hanging out of the left ear bud. Pretty disappointed in this purchase. Not worth the money.\n",
      "Not bad at all nice fit\n",
      "As expected and on time delivery - Thank you!\n",
      "The item seems used and it’s not original!!!\n",
      "The length is just great and the sound quality, bass, and noise-cancellation is crazy on this thing.\n",
      "Product is a known entity - service from order to delivery to follow up was fantastic. Thank you.\n",
      "Not apple, they break after a day\n",
      "Exactly as described & prompt shipping  will buy again!\n",

      "Perfect sound quality great price\n",
      "It’s exactly what I needed and expected.\n",
      "Great value!\n",
      "A piece of the ear bud snaps on and off. My daughter finds it very annoying.\n",
      "The microphone doesn’t work\n",
      "Appear to be really Apple Product and works well.\n",
      "I'm rally enjoying my headphones right now. They fit perfect in my ears and never fall out while I'm working out. I would highly recommend them!\n",
      "Love it\n",
      "Broken when it arrive. Looked fine until I plugged it in. On ear piece didn’t work. I had thrown out the packaging so I was stuck throwing it out and taking the loss.\n",
      "Not apple headphones\n",
      "Look great work great!\n",
      "Apple earphones are just the best!\n",
      "Much better audio quality than the original earphones that came with my Apple iPod.\n",
      "Great product! Fast shipping!\n",
      "Broken within 3 weeks\n",
      "Order and received product with no problem. Earphones work well be sounds quality is not as good as the Apple product. Sounds is tinny.\n",
      "Just the next day the product was broken :-(\n",
      "Came in working fine after 2 days left side stopped working and a day after that the right side fell apart. Save your money and don't buy these.\n",
      "works great\n",
      "NOT APPLE.  These are cheap fakes.  Don't buy them.  Not even worth the discounted price.  IDK how they get away claiming they are an apple product.  False advertising.\n",
      "They are not Apple and they don't work..\n",
      "Good\n",
      "Only one ear bud was working when it arrived.\n",
      "The apple earbuds are the best.  Tried other ones that say apple certified, but the sound is not the same.\n",
      "Look good, work good\n",
      "It s too bad. Low quality. R and L  wrong... :((\n",
      "Terrible product.  Total knockoffs.  They have inferior sound quality to the official Apple earbuds.  I regret buying them.  I cheaped out and got what I paid for.  Don't be like me and make this mistake.\n",
      "Horrible both earphones blew out so no sound comes out and i has them less than a month\n",
      "I got these for my husband who loves his original Apple earphones. He was disappointed because they were obviously not an Apple product. He uses them and they seem to work fine, but they are not the same quality as Apple.\n",
      "Good product\n",
      "Excellently sound! Authentic Apple EarPods, and came in the apple box with no damage to the EarPods.\n",
      "So good!\n",
      "Product damaged when I opened it and it had shortage in the wire don't waste ur money.\n",
      "Good quality\n",
      "Fake\n",
      "Terrible quality, unacceptable product, I should've read the reviews.\n",
      "omg love these so much, great bass and i can hear EVERYTHING in the song. beautiful. great job apple co.!\n",
      "very fast shipping. came in a nice container and the product was brand new. they came clean and neat.\n",
      "These headphones worked perfectly for two days but out of no where the left ear bud stopped working. Beyond pissed because they were 18 dollars and broke for no reason.\n",
      "old standby, just wish there could be another way?!?!, other than implanting a chip in your head?!?!?\n",
      "THIS IS FAKE DO NOT BUY THIS CRAP!!\n",
      "Best reall apple earphones mine that i got had the ting ln the nottom from apple and they ware brand new no problems\n",
      "They don't work. The mic don't work either. Must be a short in the wire\n",
      "excellent replacement\n",
      "fakedont buy. No star for this product.\n",
      "These are not Apple headphones - only the outer shell is the same.\n",
      "Noticeably cheaper knock-off. Causes loud buzzing sound on other line when using for phone calls. Bought two pairs because I thought I got a lemon, but the problem was consistent on both pairs. If you use these for phone calls, DO NOT PURCHASE.\n",
      "While these headphones look like Apple and arrive in packaging that seems like Apple, they are clearly of a very inferior quality. There is no bass response, the cables are approximately 1/3 thinner, the microphone and control module is shotty, abd the sound quality is terrible. If these are, in fact, made by Apple, it is clearly the junk they couldn't sell at retail. I will be requesting a refund. Very disappointing.\n",
      "I only had them for a month and they broke\n",
      "Not Original.\n",
      "great\n",
      "Whenever I put it in, it comes out I don't know why and I don't have time to send it back what a waste of money.\n",
      "Great Price!\n",
      "I got this package on a friday and by Monday they had broken. They hadn't been stepped on or dropped or yanked on anything and i looked over and one of the caps on the earphones (the thing that goes in your ear) had broken off. Also, before it broke, no one could understand me on the phone when I was using the headphones. Thankfully they broke fast enough for me to return them but I seriously regret buying them in the first place. Now I have to take the time to go through the returns process. You can get a much nicer pair of headphones for twelve dollars elsewhere.\n",
      "Just what I was looking for. Works as expected, nothing fancy but it works!\n",
      "As advertised.\n",
      "IF I COULD GIVE THIS ITEM ZERO STARS-- I would.\n",
      "Needed a replacement earphones and these are working just great! Delivery was fast! Would order from Veritas Cellular again. Thank You!\n",
      "Def not genuine apple product. Wasn't working properly out the box.\n",
      "Didn't work upon opening.  Very much doubt they are actual Apple product - static, other person coudn't hear, etc.\n",
      "Fake ear buds\n",
      "Fake...right one desent even work\n",
      "Just what I wanted.\n",
      "Do not buy these!!!!!!!\n",
      "Good buy! Definitely can't handle an accidental wash like the new never broken apple headphones but that's reasonable, they're referbished. If you don't wash them though you'll be just as happy as you would if you bought new ones again.\n",
      "Product was defective. The cord would not stay in the iphone headphone jack causing the music to stop if the cord moved slightly.\n",
      "Very disappointed, sound quality is mediocre and construction is decidedly hollow and cheap.\n",
      "Really great value.\n",
      "I really liked them and the sound quality was excellent but like other earbuds, one side shorted out after a couple months.\n",
      "At first they were working perfectly, I even gave them a good review. Then after a month they just stopped working completely...\n",
      "They're Apple!  No better .!  Thank you.\n",
      "I bought two of these earbuds - for myself and my son. Both pairs only worked properly for one day, and then only one earbud worked (the right side with the microphone for both). Definitely faulty. Don't buy these.\n",
      "GOOD buds convienent delivery\n",
      "Defective! Created a horrible buzzing sound every time I tried to use them for a call. Ok for listening to music. Very disappointed. I tossed the packaging because I assumed Apple was a quality product.\n",
      "Awful--got these and the left earbud did not work at all. DO NOT BUY\n",
      "fake\n",
      "The quality of the headset is bad, I have to keep moving the entrance because many times only the right part of the headset is working.\n",
      "These were .made by Apple and good.  I have bought the Chinese kind \"fake\" Apple and they are Crap.,\n",
      "I bought a couple of these ear pods. Not sure if they were used or not (as others saw), but none of them lasted more than a few months. It seemed like internally wires came loose because one ear bud would fail. Somehow Amazon must figure out a way to differentiate between the real thing (the ones actually made by Apple) and used/refurbished.  Now that I see that the reviews on this item a terrible, I won't buy them again.\n",
      "THEY suck after twice days of having them the speaker to talk to people quit working I feel like I wasted Munich money\n",
      "Can tell the difference between these and the stock ones that come with the phone.\n",
      "Headphones arrived two days ago, used them once and the left ear plug doesn’t work. Tried other headphones in my device and it’s definitely these headphones that are faulty. Not happy!\n",
      "Work for 2 month and then the right side stop working , like every apple headphone that i have before , never buy another apple product again , really low quality and high price\n",
      "Broke the day after return window closed. One side doesn't work at all. Do not waste your money.\n",
      "Cheap, thin, parts make rattle noise. What a dumb idiot I am for trusting what I read.\n",
      "The headphones did not work at all\n",
      "The left earpod broke within a week of getting them in the mail. They feel super cheap and NOT like the Apple brand.\n",
      "Don't buy it, this is a piece of garbage... REALLY PISS OFF\n",
      "They work great and the sound is great!  No issue with delivery.  On time\n",
      "These are knock off’s for sure. Uncomfortable and lots of static.\n",
      "Love the ear pods. Fantastic sound quality. Use them in a noisy environment and am able to hear music or vocals well. Had a pair when i bought i phone and lost them. These have brought back the enjoyment i missed!\n",
      "The real deal\n",
      "Horrible. OEM? Not even close. Used for three days and already fell apart, wires broken and everything.\n",
      "The quality is lacking and they broke within a couple weeks without being mistreated at all.\n",
      "DO NOT WORK DON'T BUY\n",
      "Defective.  Could not use them at all.\n",
      "Horrible quality. The remote buttons do not work and the sound is muffled and quiet. Do NOT buy waste of money.\n",
      "I love this product, I have bought two of the same.\n",
      "These headphones have very poor sound quality.\n",
      "I got them 3 weeks ago and they were fine in the beginning but then the sound started fading and then one side got so stretched out that only one of them barely works!! Don't​ buy this product\n",
      "Product received quickly and in original packing.  I like the product a lot.\n",
      "Doesn't feel like real apple earbuds, also the when I got it the volume control/pause button doesn't work.\n",
      "sounds way different from the real one. should've bought the real product at the store instead\n",
      "This is a fake product.... dont buy\n",
      "These headphones were not the Apple headphones. They were a knock off version. The sound quality was aweful. I was fooled!\n",
      "Not an Apple product.\n",
      "They weren't even working when I got them. Sent them back. Got a refund, so I can't give em 0 stars.\n",
      "It’s an apple earpods knock off! I only got it yesterday and now the jack is broken. It’s a POS!!!\n",
      "I bought this product 5 days ago and is arrived just 3 days ago. at the second utilization one of the two earbud stop working. I requested the refund immediately. I'm not sure they're fake, but it never happened with the real apple earpods\n",
      "As an average user this has been a cheap pair of earpods.\n",
      "These are fake.. they are the worst copy we have ever seen, there are kinks in the wires. There are wires sticking out of the earbuds....\n",
      "I received these headphones and went immediately to use them. Unfortunately, while I could hear sound it was extremely muffled and sometimes you could hear a distinct crackle and pop. These extremely disappointed me.\n",
      "Knockoff garbage. Straight out of the box, they only work half the time. Crackling, disconnecting, etc. The real Apple earpods are trash, too, but these manage to be even worse.\n",
      "excellent quality\n",
      "Total waste of money. They don't work and they mess with your phone. I wish I could get my money back >:(\n",
      "There is no way that this is a genuine Apple product. The sound quality is terrible and when instered into the device it causes the phone app to quit. Also, I'm pretty sure it was used as the buds looked dirty.\n",
      "I bought these because the apple headphones I got with my iphone in 2015 stopped having sound output in one ear. But after just one month, these headphones have already stopped functioning properly. Sound is only coming out of one ear so I am back where I started. These also did not seem to be actual Apple headphones when i took them out of the package. They are much lower quality than the ones that came with my phone. These do not stay in my ears while exercising and I have never had issues with actual apple headphones in the past.\n",
      "Fake earpods. Remote doesn’t work, overall sound is horrible.\n",
      "Headphone quality is terrible compared to past apple headphones I've used. Sound sounds empty and faded. Doesn't fit well in ear- allows external sound to filter through, making music sound terrible.\n",
      "Don't buy it! Don't but it! It's completely fake!\n",
      "They broke after one week :(\n",
      "f these headphones\n",
      "ARE FAKE AND HORRIBLE QUALITY. ARE NOT ORIGINAL. FAIL.\n",
      "Earphones appear used!! Really!\n",
      "It's works Great\n",
      "Very good product\n",
      "The microphone doesn’t work. Headphones work, just can’t use them on a phone call\n",
      "They did not work. And one the left speaker was broken when it came. One of them also had blue ink on it but otherwise weren’t bad.\n",
      "I ordered these to replace the headphones that came with my iPhone 6. I’m not sure these are Apple. Sound quality is poorer than Apple headphones.\n",
      "The microphone piece doesn’t work. Can’t move the volume up and down or start/stop music or end calls. Had to send back.\n",
      "ordered 6 pairs of these as my daughters are always breaking theirs (what do kids ears do with ear buds that adults do not do?) great cheap and lasted as long as expected, I think Im still using them for the gym..2 years later\n",
      "Teribble quality. There’s a constant buzzing sound in the background of any song I put. The right headphone insert just broke. DO NOT BUY IM SERIOUS\n",
      "sending the item back .. item recieved was used and dirty ..\n",
      "Good\n",
      "FAKE APPLE PRODUCTS!!!!!!\n",
      "The left side doesn’t work.\n",
      "You can easily tell the difference between Apple Original and this one.\n",
      "The sound quality isnot authentic like the real apple earpods and one side broke in a day and I barely used it\n",
      "Excellent ear buds but picture is of CARDBOARD & NOT PLASTIC box.\n",
      "These are NOT Apple headphones. The EarPods came tangled in original Apple packaging, but the product itself is a horrendous knock off. The volume rocker is jammed so volume stays at 0 when plugged in, the quality of the cord is very low quality, and these have a gold input jack, definitely not authentic.\n",
      "Came with right earbud and inline mic broken, also felt far cheaper than true apple earpods.\n",
      "They broke :(\n",
      "My earphones were delivered already broke!! The volume/pause control buttons all were not working when I opened package .\n",
      "There a piece of trash they worked for one day then one ear stopped working\n",
      "I wasn't convinced of quality by some of the reviews, but I will say that the two I bought were 'new' and full quality from my experience.  So count me in for 2 votes of Good to Go.\n",
      "I'm pleased with its performance.\n",
      "The remote doesn't work. I can't adjust the volume, skip songs, answer calls, etc. with the remote. Highly disappointed with this product and will return it.\n",
      "Stops working after a while\n",
      "Complete trash. Sound quality is terrible and nothing like the original apple headphones. These are a cheap knock off. The ear buds are not the original shape of the apple ear buds and do not stay in your ears. Earbuds are useless if they won't stay in your ears.\n",
      "These earbuds are plain awful. Horrible audio quality and they broke after 3 uses. Do not buy.\n",
      "As expected.\n",
      "They were neither Apple brand nor were they functional earbuds. Only the right earbud works, the left side is completely dead.\n",
      "To make this as straight-forward as possible, I'm going to put my review into a few categories; Design, Sound, Comfort, and Price.\n",
      "These are amazing! They're like the real thing only for a cheaper price. 10/10 recommended.\n",
      "good value\n",
      "Thanks\n",
      "This product is bad quality !\n",
      "Not apple\n",
      "Great product great price\n",
      "They work enough but sound awful compared to real ones. Won't make this mistake again. Only giving 1 star because I have to.\n",
      "Worked well and delivers on time\n",
      "nice\n",
      "Excellent product and lightning quick shipping!\n",
      "The headphone parts came apart a week after I used it, definitely never buying this. Very disappointed.\n",
      "Good item for this price\n",
      "Sound has already gone out in the left ear pod.\n",
      "It works perfect!\n",
      "These earbuds went out within 2 months. Not worth it.\n",
      "Amazing\n",
      "Poor quality headphones, not comparable to Apple earbuds\n",
      "These look like the originals, sound good and come in the same container as the real one. Great price and quality. Recommend.\n",
      "Had to buy these twice because my dog chewed the first one, haven’t had any problems with either ones though.\n",
      "Love the fit and sounds awesome. Love that you can still hear what’s going on around you outside the headphones.\n",
      "Bought for my daughter who has the new iPhone she loves them\n",
      "I can only use these style of earbuds, great price!\n",
      "Fast shipping.  Grandson loves them\n",
      "Got these for my 15 year old, since she loves these apple style headphones.  She loves them, and they're exactly what they say they are - Apple earpods w/ remote/volume+-\n",
      "Is real. I’m using them and they sound really good. Thank you\n",
      "original apple quality works great\n",
      "So I tried to be nice and do my boyfriends laundry and clean up a bit while he was asleep. I wanted the next day to be something special for us.  I forgot to check his pockets and I washed his ear buds. I thought I destroyed them, turns out I wasn't the first one to wash them. Lol I replaced them and he's very happy with em, almost.\n",
      "The volume buttons do not work\n",
      "Ripped right away. Y’all suck.\n",
      "They stopped working with 48 hours. What a waste\n",
      "They look like Apple headphones at arm length, but as others have said these feel cheap and do not function properly. Nothing but static out of the earbuds regardless of the source.\n",
      "The first time I used them I noticed that the sound on one side kept fading in and out. Going to return.\n",
      "This is not an original Apple Earpods, and the audio is extremely low quality.\n",
      "Terrible knock offs. Pretty sure they’re not apple made. Sound is bad.\n",
      "Just got today, plugged them in and went for a walk , and well they have a short in them already couldn't find a way to message u instead of posting this (sorry)\n",
      "good quality for the price\n",
      "Broken in a week for left side, and loose on right side\n",
      "Mic piece broke off 2nd day and they aren't real apple buds\n",
      "These ear buds are awful for the price I paid. So much static. People on other end have a hard time understanding me.\n",
      "These definitely aren't Apple!  Poor quality audio and cheap product and packaging.\n",
      "The volume-up key in remote control has no \"click\" when pressed. Even I bought this new one, it looks like already broken\n",
      "They sound meh, and I’m really annoyed because these feel fake. The wires feel very cheap and the sound isn’t the quality my iPhone earbuds provide. Shady vendor, I will never be buying from, ever again. Looking to report for using apple’s logo illegally.\n",
      "This is a scam. I received cheap headphones that do not resemble anything like the actual Apple headphones. The case is cheap, the wires are cheap and the earbuds are cheap.\n",
      "Seems exactly like the real ones\n",
      "Good\n",
      "These were horrible..that's all I can say.If this allowed zero stars, I'd give it. I took a chance not going to the actual Apple store and will NEVER make that mistake again. The earpods were cheap-look and feel. The sound was like you are in a tunnel. Horrendous. I tried them to go running and stopped mid-run because  I preferred to run in silence rather than subject myself to the sound of these headphones. Just as a final check, I dug through my closet and found a pair of old Apple earpods and tried them in the same ipod and the difference was absolutely magical.  If anything, this experience made me really appreciate the quality of original Apple earpods ;)  DO NOT BUY THESE!!!!!!!\n",
      "These only lasted about 6 weeks... don't buy them!\n",
      "worthy..\n",
      "Ummm, here's the deal.  When you advertise a product as new, it should probably be new.  I got a pair of these (allegedly) Apple EarPods which were in the plastic box, which was clearly opened, scuffed, used, etc. with a sticker saying \"New\".  I'm not sure how you can claim something's new when it's not.  These EarPods may be fine.  They may be a legit Apple product.  But, come on...\n",
      "These work perfectly with my iPhone. The clarity of the music is exactly what you would want out of a set of headphones. I would recommend these to anyone who needs headphones for their devices.\n",
      "Two days using them they broke.\n",
      "randomly quit working after a few months\n",
      "These are terrible. My son has been complaining about the sound for months. I finally tried them and he was right. In order to hear anything, you have to twist the earbud in a way that makes them fall out constantly. I don't know if it is still possible to get our money back on these but I am hoping for a full refund. These are not real Apple earbuds.\n",
      "I love using earbuds that only one side works and it's all static. Total Junk\n",
      "I used them for 2 weeks and they worked great and sounded great. Then randomly out of no where the left ear stopped working so now I'm stuck with only the right ear working. YYYYYAAAAAAYYYYY. This product sucks\n",
      "Loud and great quality! Did not distort as I raised the volume. Packaging was secure.\n",
      "The quality of these earphones is horrible ,even the sound sounds terrible on them. I do not recommend\n",
      "These headphones have a very weak sound.  They sound like I’m listening through a tin can, and the left bud does not produce a consistent sound.\n",
      "Awesome\n",
      "broke the day after i bought them.\n",
      "Came with the cord broken. Only one earbud works\n",
      "Headphones were clearly \"used.\"  They had different markings on each bud and were in a nonsecure case upon arrival.  It was clear that a sticker was peeled off the case.  I barely had to lift to open the case as it was not secured. It is gross not knowing whose ears these were already in prior to my purchase.\n",
      "Fake\n",
      "Didn't really read any reviews before I bought because I thought it's \"apple\" so it couldn't be too bad. But first it came after 4 days not 2 days, I have amazon prime and I didn't order them on weekend. Then second it didn't come with the original apple box only the plastic box which should be inside a bigger box. At that point I suspect it was not from apple. Last third thing is it borke after a week by accidentally pulled the wire a little harder. My original apple head phone had been pulled many many many times and chewed by my dog several times then it broke. This one I got borke just with one small pull, so I start looking into the reviews and now I am sure it's fake. DO NOT BUY IT! Completely wast of money!\n",
      "Arrived on time. Exactly what my 13 yr old wanted to use.\n",
      "Definitely not OEM, Real or anything close to being an Apple Product....works for now but definitely not what was advertised. The real give away was the thickness of the cables...thin and cheap.\n",
      "Always great to have a pair of etc earpods.\n",
      "Don't buy those. they are not genuine Apple ones even though it says apple part #.\n",
      "Surprised with the sound which had nice bass however they bent at the plug adapter after a few months and permanently broke.\n",
      "Doesn't work and side by side the real thing you can tell it is a nockoff.\n",
      "After reading negative reviews I was skeptical. I bought a $29.99 pair yesterday from the Apple store while I was waiting for shipment especially since I might have to send them back. (Should have been patient...) The 2017 pair has new packaging (no more plastic cube) but these appear in completely authentic and sealed Apple packaging (dated 2012) that I remember from my last pair. Cannot physically tell the difference between the 2 pairs at all. I have marked each pair to see if one does indeed last longer than the other.\n",
      "I ordered 2 at the same time and neither 1 worked! 1 both ear pieces worked but the speaker did not and 1 only one of the ear pieces worked. Not worth the effort to return.\n",
      "Just got these today was so excited l. Looked just like my other ones that broke. Went to use them and the microphone hardly even picked up my voice. It wasn’t in and out \n",
      "Will repurchase! Good dupe for the real iPhone headphones. They look like the real ones.\n",
      "If you like the OEM sound and fit, then you will like these.\n",
      "Fake!! Cheap, horrible!\n",
      "Worked fine for a month and now the left ear bud is complete static. For how much these cost they should not break so quickly. I can barely use them now because my ear hurts with all the static.\n",
      "Really great. Everything was brand new\n",
      "nice\n",
      "After using this product for 1 week the left earphone no longer works\n",
      "I had these for one month and the left ear piece just stopped working. I only used them twice a week. No damage to them whatsoever, just stopped working.\n",
      "These lasted me a year, which is when I lost them. Would recommend. Only draw back is the shipping. If you are getting these from china, expect to wait a few weeks.\n",
      "thx\n",
      "Fake - the headphone wires are wiry and the sound is terrible. Also, it looked like these had the lightning adapter but they came with a headphone jack\n",
      "Works great love the sound quality\n",
      "Good\n",
      "Nice headphone work well\n",
      "Already broke. Had to go buy a new pair. Went to best buy and bought oem. One year warranty.\n",
      "As advertised\n",
      "Bought 2 pairs.  One broke immediately (only one ear worked).  The other's sound quality is awful.  Very tinny sounding.  Will not buy again.\n",
      "Did not work.\n",
      "Does the job\n",
      "Broke three days later. Not going to recommend\n",
      "These are FAKE. I had these for a single day and one of the earphones broke. So I compared them to my old set which they were supposed to replace. Only then did I realize the gauge of wire is all wrong and the plastic and finish on the headphones is completely different. Save your money and go buy the slightly more expensive ones from the apple store.\n",
      "Love the ear phones just what I wanted. Works really good!\n",
      "i purchased these less than one month ago and they have already stopped working. unsure if this a knockoff company or if apple products have actually gone downhill.\n",
      "Packaging didn't look new and they don't even work. The first time I tried to use them there was already a short in the wires and only one pod worked.\n",
      "They sound pretty good, but arrived broken. One ear worked properly, remote worsened the condition. Sad boy here :(\n",
      "Good but not the original\n",
      "Terrible quality, sound nothing like what they’re supposed to be. Actual Apple earphones\n",
      "Don't buy!!!\n",
      "Every single pair for sale says they are fake, these are not. I'm ordering these again after they lasted me nearly two years of hard everyday use .\n",
      "My son loves the earpods! He says they are the best earpods he's tried.\n",
      "These earphones are NOT from Apple. They are fake AF. Do not buy because they are poor quality.\n",
      "OK\n",
      "Broken up when it came and only one of the earphones actually worked\n",
      "Great, works as intended!\n",
      "Broke in less than two months of light use. Most likely due to a short in the wiring the audio will now play only out of one ear :(\n",
      "Good\n",
      "It does not work. I feel really sad!\n",
      "Exactly what my daughter asked for and way less expensive than other local retailers.\n",
      "Good sound, easy to clean, very durable.\n",
      "I cannot believe I still have them and they still works. I’ve even washed them in the washer and dryer (unknowingly of course).\n",
      "This came in an original box!\n",
      "Extremely disappointed. The right earphone does not work at all. Would give 0 stars if possible.\n",
      "Not durable headphone. Hardly used but started giving problem.\n",
      "Sound quality is Not great at all and Two days after I received them the right earbud stopped working. I feel like they are cheap knock offs. Buyer beware!\n",
      "Volume up button does not work, volume is crackly\n",
      "Very good EarPods. Never look for cheap item. It ends up being expensive  because it doesn't last\n",
      "Last me a whole week before one side stopped working. Cheap knock off.\n",
      "Not good sound quality\n",
      "The headphones were delivered fast and work very well. Thank you.\n",
      "Work great\n",
      "Good quality sound, works perfect\n",
      "Got the headphone and they did not work.\n",
      "Terrible\n",
      "Everything looked good up until the packaging. Sound quality is horrible, it sounds like the music is playing from a foot away. Also doesn’t come in standard apple packaging\n",
      "I enjoyed these earbuds for maybe a day or two. But after that the left earbud broke, and now it won't play any audio whatsoever. There isn't any cosmetic damage to the earbud, or at least nothing you can see from the outside. I am extremely disappointed with these earbuds\n",
      "Quality is poor. One side is already not working. Barely lasted a month!\n",
      "Left side is already not working. Only had it a month and it went out!\n",
      "Works well enough for music, but they came with a damaged microphone.\n",
      "Good sound.  Does the good.\n",
      "Worked great, until my dog ate them. :( I guess I'll order another set.\n",
      "In good condition!\n",
      "Works as expected.\n",
      "Much smaller and cheaper made than actual apple ear pods\n",
      "The volume is not equal from ear to ear.  And yes, I tried switching them and did not have the issue with other headphones.\n",
      "I read the negative comments and was concerned about purchasing this item... But I'm so glad I did! Item came as described- brand new in original Apple packaging. I love these headphones (: best, cheapest in the ear headphones that have lasted the longest of all the pairs I've owned\n",
      "These work as good as the ones that came originally in the iPhone box.\n",
      "It broke in a week, and definitely wasn't apple \"refurbished\" it was a knock off\n",
      "I spilled hard cider on the left earbud after using the set for like three years.  It didn't work anymore.  Then, the next morning, after it dried out on the kitchen table overnight, it worked just fine as before.  What a great product!!\n",
      "I would never recommend buying this product.  Please save your money and buy a true \"Apple\" product.\n",
      "They work great I can't believe how good they are\n",
      "These are the only ear pods that fit my ears.\n",
      "These were supposed to be OEM headphones and I expected them to sounds just like the ones that come with iPhone. However these were anything but. Within 20 seconds of wearing them I realized they completely lacked ANY base notes, and sounded extremely flat. These are akin to the first iPod headphones from the early 2000s. Nothing like the EarPods that we know and love today. Do NOT be fooled by this listing! Very poor sounding headphones.\n",
      "They are ok, they are from Apple but they don't feel or weigh the same as the orig I received when I purchased the phone.\n",
      "They work great haven't had any issues at all. \n",
      "Arrived on time and just as advertised.\n",
      "Very cheap. They literally fall apart. I guess u get what u pay for\n",
      "They lasted just about one month to the day I purchased them. Worked find on my morning commute, but 10 hours later the left EarPod did not work at all. Completely useless now. What are the odds I could take these to Apple and try to get them replaced under the one year warranty?\n",
      "I recently bought the Apple MD827LL/A EarPods with Remote and Mic - Standard Packaging - White  and the volume buttons don't work at all\n",
      "product worked for a limited time\n",
      "I these are knock-off headphones.  The packaging looks legit, but when you connect to an Apple phone the quality is something you would get from the dollar store.  DO NOT BUY!!!\n",
      "Horrible quality didn't last A WEEK\n",
      "They chipped and my left earbud speaker blew a couple days later:( I think it might be a factory error.\n",
      "The left headphone as something lose in it.  It's annoying cause it raddles!\n",
      "Bad quality.\n",
      "A very short Cable !\n",
      "These headphones had degraded sound compared with other Apple EarPods I've previously owned.  At first, I thought I was just hearing things poorly, but upon testing these headphones against identical Apple EarPods it was clear that there is a problem with the product.  I will be returning them.\n",
      "Works with my Iphone well but rarely glitches and doesn't let me adjust the volume through the earpods. I cannot adjust the volume/pause using these earpods with my Ipod. Really Good for the price.\n",
      "Do NOT buy these ear pods!!!  They screech so loud in your ear like a high-pitched jackhammer and you can't get them out of your ear fast enough.  My husband scratched his face so deeply trying to get them out.  These are dangerous and there should/could be a class action law suit against APPLE.\n",
      "I just received this item and to be honest, I was a bit nervous that the ear phones would be fake. Everyone commented saying do not buy bc the ear phones are fake. But the ear phones are 100 percent real.\n",
      "good\n",
      "Moderate quality. Not long lasting.\n",
      "Works well. I' m still using them, and would order these earbuds again.\n",
      "my grandson loves them\n",
      "Originally gave 5 stars but product quickly stopped working\n",
      "Excellent\n",
      "Great product, received in time expected.\n",
      "Horrible I can't turn the volume up or down on the headset, the only thing it does is play back the previous song.\n",
      "It came in the original apple packaging. Can't tell the difference between and brand new EarPods and the refurbished. Works as well.\n",
      "My son loves them!! That's all he will use\n",
      "thank you\n",
      "The right earbud is broken, the controls on the wire don't work, unclean.\n",
      "Probably fake earphone from apple. I was skeptical when I opened the box and the feeling when I touched it\n",
      "Left ear you coukd not hear out of.\n",
      "Have one month of having these, they are already broken. No sound comes in through one of the earpieces anymore. I chose to pay more to get the name brand. Obviously these are a knockoff and not actually Apple earpods. The quality is sub-par...would NOT recommend.\n",
      "Very good.\n",
      "Immediately after taking them out of their package and using them, I found that I can't adjust the volume, activate siri or use the microphone on the right hand wire. On top of that, right where the two EarPods meet, the sound becomes garbled and stops working if it's adjusted the slightest bit. I don't have the packaging to return them unfortunately, but if I did I would. I'm hoping to buy a new pair that will actually work. Disappointed \n",
      "To give background, I purchased these for my girlfriend who needed new headphones and is away for college. she loved them for a week, then they started acting defective. it wasn't until 3 weeks after purchase that they fully broke and she never told me that they were different to the original product. photos show 3rd parry branding of the headphones, and that the speakers tint blue. Do not buy these, they are fake. (Photos provided by girlfriend)\n",
      "The EarPods broke after two weeks. The controls stop working and people on the other end could barely hear me.\n",
      "The volume buttons on the earbuds don't work at all, very disappointed in what I got for what I payed\n",
      "This item had a shortage in them.\n",
      "Headphones are not balanced properly. Not good sound effects.\n",
      "Didn't last long and really bad cords and connections.\n",
      "Garbage\n",
      "I expected something may be wrong with them as they were only about $10 \"new\" in original packaging. The microphone does not work. You can listen to music and hear the other person on the phone, but they can barely hear you. Disappointed, will return.\n",
      "This item is a total bootleg/knock off of real Apple earbuds. The sound quality is AM radio quality and the wire insulation feels hard and cheap.  DO NOT BUY.\n",
      "Only the right earbud worked and now it won't let me return it even after I emailed them and they haven't responded. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!\n",
      "Left earphone did not work as soon as it came in. Very sad, had to throw it away.\n",
      "Great headphones.. Some of the best in ear headphones in the market!!1\n",
      "Excellent\n",
      "Good\n",
      "These EarPods work exactly as advertised. I purchased them, mainly, because I wear hearing aids, and in-the-ear \"earbuds\" don't fit properly for me. These rest in the proper place so that I don't have to remove my hearing aids.\n",
      "Was clearly used and did not work!\n",
      "A waste of money, the sound quality is very bad when I opened them and used them right away.\n",
      "One stopped working after about two weeks.\n",
      "BROKE IN ONE DAY! the right earphone vibrates horribly with ANY kind of bass. easily the worst product APPLE continues to sell.\n",
      "Not very pleased with this product at all! Of course received on time but 2 months later they are soundless! An APPLE product. The issue for me is that we disposed of the packaging and can't send it back. This is frustrating and I absolutely don't like wasting money on a 'so-called' quality product.\n",
      "just like apple headphones you first get\n",
      "Got the product on time, but the mic doesn't work. VERY disappointed\n",
      "Good ones\n",
      "Product was as expected\n",
      "The head sets break after one week of use. I doubt this product is Apple and never had a chance to return until now (3 mo later) no returns now.\n",
      "It was not 100% genuine. The sound was unclear and warbled as if I was trying to talk to someone underwater. Rather than look for cheap knockoffs, we should all just suck it up and pay the $30 for the official version.\n",
      "Fast shipping, what I needed, thank you!\n",
      "Purchased this -a little over one month later, the right-earpiece completely fails. This indicates either the headphones were defective (which is not common with these OEM earpods) or they're really well-designed (aesthetically) fakes.\n",
      "Love them even though it isn't a Authentic apple earbuds but it feel like one. It last me 3 months now and going. The one con u might find is the sound might sound a little bad then the authentic ones but I  hardly notice. I use them everyday for the gym, running and casual use\n",
      "I bought these EarPods to replace my original ones because the left earbud was much, much louder than the right earbud and I couldn't stand it anymore. This is a  problem I have always had with Apple's EarPods since they came out long ago. I have constantly replaced them because they're honestly not that bad, and it's only every six months or so that I have to replace them. I received these headphones literally an hour before writing this review and I'm sad to say that the same issue plaguing my six-month old EarPods are plaguing these literally brand-new out of the box headphones. I know this isn't the seller's fault, but it's Apple's, but it's best if you just buy different headphones altogether. I checked whether it was my phone, I checked whether it was my Lightning adapter, I checked whether it was my own hearing; it's literally just the headphones.\n",
      "It looks 95% like Apple product, but it's not. Lasted only 3 months. I suggest to buy it in reputed stores.\n",
      "Great!\n",
      "This is clearly not the real deal.  The sound stopped working and I've only had for a few days.  I can't hear anything and no one can hear me.  Now I have to go through the hassle of sending back, when they need to be thrown away.  Very disappointed\n",
      "These headphones are horrible. As soon as I plug them in I get a static sound. I have to spin the jack around until I can find a spot where the sound goes away.\n",
      "Quality is not the same as original set that come with phone.\n",
      "Worst product stopped working in 1 week\n",
      "Very good\n",
      "Within six weeks of owning these headphones, the stereo sound on the first pair failed. They only work out of the right ear. GRRR.\n",
      "A+\n",
      "Transports me to another dimension\n",
      "They work great. I lost my first pair but found them after I had my new pair for a week. Well now I have two.\n",
      "Worked well for 10-14 days, then the microphone went out. Seller was responsive and I returned fur a refund (free shipping).\n",
      "These ended up being junk. We had them for a week and they no longer work. You can't hear anything through the buds.\n",
      "I have got Apple Earbuds before, so when I found them on amazon at a cheaper price, I was excited. I use them all the time, and I have not had any issues with them.\n",
      "Work fine and pretty good sound,\n",
      "I've purchased two or three from this listing and I noticed they don't last as long as the buds that came with each of my iPhones. They fall apart and frey within 3-6 months. I decided to order a pair of these and a new pair direct from Apple to compare.\n",
      "Too bad  firstly, remote and mic are broken after that headphone is broken. I do not recommend you this headphone.\n",
      "They worked only for 2 weeks. It stopped working out of nowhere and they weren't even broken physically.\n",
      "Bought a couple pairs because I lose headphones constantly. Just opened these yesterday and they've broken in an unusual way\n",
      "Sound from Apple ear pods is fantastic.\n",
      "The reason why is because one of the ear stopped working after the second week\n",
      "Not an authentic Apple product.  These do not work at all.\n",
      "Good sound\n",
      "Original music quality. Fair price.\n",
      "This is not made by Apple - the look is very similar though.  My problem is that when I talk using this headphones people complain about 'helicopter' noise. I did A-B testing using my original Apple earbuds and confirmed that the 'helicopter' noise is caused by the purchased earbuds.  Won't purchase again.\n",
      "Worked perfectly and arrived quick\n",
      "Works Fine!\n",
      "Got these on July 11th and today's August 31st and I have to order a new one. No one can hear me and its like it has some type of shortage. Terrible\n",
      "My son didn't say anything, so they are working. We ordered a pair from somewhere else and could only hear out of one ear. So we are good with this pair. Thanks. No complaints.\n",
      "When I opened I notice a black mark on ear buds that made them almost seem used. The first time I used them only the right ear bud produced sound. Nothing from left at all. Returned.\n",
      "Perfect and fast!\n",
      "Brand new in box. Perfect.\n",
      "Very good, lasts long\n",
      "I used the EarPods few times, and its no longer working. After few times of use, I could use only \"one\" phone. Couldn't  hear from one of the sides. Unfortunately. I don't have a good review about this product.\n",
      "They didn't work after using them a couple times.\n",
      "Exactly what I needed, no issues whatsoever!\n",
      "Left speaker not working right out of the box!!! Do not buy. Not quality headphones\n",
      "Terrible earphones. The left earphone already had a shortage. It had a weird sound at the beginning of my use. I've only been using them for a week.\n",
      "Original one , I like it\n",
      "I love these EarPods when they are on sale. Need to go on sale again soon .\n",
      "Work great!\n",
      "I always loved the quality! works great!\n",
      "These headphones suck like actually suck. The quality came in muffled than original headphones and I've only had it for a month and the right phone is already busted. Crappy product. DO NOT BUY.\n",
      "Work great. The only headphones for me\n",
      "Came broken in one ear\n",
      "Work great thanks.\n",
      "This is what I received. Everyone suspected they were NOT genuine Apple, as other reviewers have so stated with photos. I sent it back without even open it.\n",
      "This is what I received. Would you order it?? I have sent it back within 48 hours.\n",
      "I could not find this dental floss anywhere. I got a sample from my dentist and loved it. It just glides thru my teeth.\n",
      "These suck, plain and simple. The only good thing about them is the buttons work, quality is terrible and the volume is very low. I’m only out $10 so can’t complain too much I guess....\n",
      "Great purchase. The OEM product is really the best.\n",
      "I love these ear buds! I use these all the time (sleep with them to drown out noise and garden with them... ). Needless to say I am fairly rough so I get about a year (maybe just shy of that) out of each pair. Normal people could easily get longer. They are comfortable and I love the easy access to the volume button. Buy them! They are worth it!\n",
      "Broke within two weeks.\n",
      "Stopped working after 2 months and made of cheap plastic\n",
      "A Great buy\n",
      "Great!\n",
      "they broke after 3 days\n",
      "Terrible quality DO NOT BUY\n",
      "This product has to be fake. It stopped working after 6 weeks.\n",
      "They work great and came in on time!\n",
      "I had bought these previously and had good luck. The product appeared to be new, and they lasted me for several years before my 2-year-old got hold of them. That's the only reason for the 4 stars.\n",
      "They broke after 3 weeks\n",
      "This product is a gift\n",
      "Got these as a gift for my husband after he accidentally ran over his in the parking lot.  They did not work at all, one side only produced static. Ended up driving to the store to get the real deal. Don't waste your time on these.\n",
      "Don't buy!!!! I should have listen to the other reviews. The earbud is used( as shown in the picture, there is some black dirt on it! So gross!)  Also the color is fading off....\n",
      "Even though they're not legit apple earphones they're very close to it. Worth the pay. The speaker and audio control on them work great unlike some of the other knockoffs that don't work for nothing. The sound of course aren't like the real apple earphones, but it's as close as it's gonna get.\n",
      "They fell apart, some within the first 30 minutes of use.\n",
      "Horrible\n",
      "One earbud stops working after a week. quality is not good either. worst purchase ever\n",
      "do not buy these\n",
      "AVOID--  My pair lasted only one week,  these are knock offs.\n",
      "Awesome\n",
      "The right side ear bud and microphone stopped working within a week of receiving.\n",
      "I haven't even had them for that long and they just stopped working mid use. I heard some static and they just stopped.\n",
      "Same packaging and product as when you purchase any apple product.  Works great!\n",
      "I am not satisfied with this product. Not properly working after 40 days\n",
      "Low quality sound and weird filters on the headphones. This product is trash!\n",
      "Headphones didn't work.  I'm going to just have to go to the store to get them because everything I buy online always seems to not last.\n",
      "Bought them July 29th it's Aug 15th and 1 side has already stopped working.\n",
      "just no. don't buy.\n",
      "Can't even hear anything when I use them. Tried them with my phone and laptop, but the sound is very quiet!\n",
      "The volume control doesn't work.\n",
      "The headphones were great until i started running with them. They were making popping noises and shocked my ears!\n",
      "Great price and fast shipping!\n",
      "Doesn't work when being used to talk on the phone\n",
      "it came broken. Don't buy it.\n",
      "Fake Apple earphones under the brand \"Mosidun\"\n",
      "It's easier to just get real headphones\n",
      "My son is happy\n",
      "yes, these are earbuds that play music. but the size of the earbuds differs, making it impossible to fit correctly in my ear. it won't stay in when going on runs. the little bar on the earbuds that controls volume doesn't work at all, which is why I bought these earbuds in the first place.\n",
      "The headphones were great, but i could easily tell they were fake when they came. They shouldn't be marketed as apple headphones if they aren't actually OEM Apple headphones.\n",
      "Not new and right earbud didn't work. Paid $10 just to ship it back.\n",
      "Terrible!  Defective!  I'm not sure if these are cheap knockoffs or not, but they keep fading out.  None of my other headphones do that.\n",
      "Deserves less than one star! Stopped working within 2 weeks.\n",
      "These are fake. Do not buy!!\n",
      "Apple of course doesn't upset me . It was exactly what I pictured. I recommend\n",
      "Work great!!!\n",
      "Piece of garbage! After 3 days using it just at the gym the left side is not working.\n",
      "could not trust it was a real one, so returned it.\n",
      "If you want good EarPods go for some other ones. These are not real apple EarPods! They are okay when using once or twice, though the material it is made of may hurt your ears after awhile! The cord has broken off of many of my purchases! What I recommend, look for other earphones.\n",
      "100% original Headphone of Apple\n",
      "Hasn't even been two weeks and the left ear won't work. Troubleshot for about an hour (including trying to test other headphones and devices as controls). One star for throwing my money away.\n",
      "They are definitely not genuine apple earbuds but they do look real and sound real so 4/5\n",
      "These earbuds are fake. Just look at all the other reviews. DO NOT BUY\n",
      "Defective products\n",
      "This does not seems original apple product. the one I lost and this one has totally different quality, does not stuck in my ear.. totally disappointed.\n",
      "Apple product and quality as expected!\n",
      "Really only needed 1 pair... I ordered two due to price and convenience...only one pair worked correctly...\n",
      "Just as described\n",
      "Sound only comes out one of the buds and the quality is tinny and has a scratchy overtone. Should've read the reviews on here before buying. Don't get these.\n",
      "ok\n",
      "Great quality\n",
      "They don't work.\n",
      "While i didnt care that they weren't authentic Apple headphones. they still sounded pretty good but mine didn't even last 2 weeks. Bought these to use at work and right earbud does not work anymore.\n",
      "Not bad but they are fake and the sound quality compared to the real ones are pretty similar but apples are better.\n",
      "These are either water-damaged (mine smelled like cigarette smoke) or they are completely not Apple headphones as advertised. Sound quality is barely better than the ones I bought for $1 at a dollar store. It sounds like the music is inside a tin can.\n",
      "Total crap...not authentic Apple product. Only buy if you like crap.\n",
      "Bought this for the grandson's iPhone 6s and it works great. He had bought a used phone that did not come with the headphones. There were a nice replacement.\n",
      "Sound quality decent. Volume buttons do not work.\n",
      "I agree with everyone I just got these headphones a week ago and they are totally fake I had it for todays and I dropped my phone with the headphones in the left ear bud broke apart. Then today my phone fell and the right ear bud broke and the wire broke as well. So then I threw out the headphones. Don't buy this product it's not worth spending your money on, buy the real ones even though they are expensive it's real.\n",
      "Headphones aren’t loud\n",
      "Extremely bad quality. Wire joint to speaker appeared loose and one side of the speaker didn't have sound. Had to shake the wire a bit to get that speaker working. Would never buy this product again.\n",
      "Great price so why pay full price at the apple store. Purchase as a backup or replacement pair.\n",
      "Knock off clone. They look very similar to actual Apple Ear Pods, but they are not. One star for the fact they're advertised as Apple products, but they are not.\n",
      "Bad it had mold on it\n",
      "It stopped working after a month, don't buy this product. They are not actual apple headphones.\n",
      "Fake!!, horrible sound! Save your money,\n",
      "L chipo brand\n",
      "I haven't used these EarPods yet, I purchased them as a back up to my current EarPods, which hasn't been lost or broken yet.\n",
      "Easy to use .easily lead to thread short circuit.easy to break.\n",
      "This is not working, I reallly hate this. This is not original, its a duplicate product,\n",
      "bought two pairs of these.  both are broken within a week.  going to try to return.\n",
      "Product stopped working two weeks after purchase, currently only one headphone working as well. product doesn't sound like the original headphones that came with the iPhone.\n",
      "Not the most comfortable earbuds on the market, but they hold up to abuse.\n",
      "Absolutely terrible product! To anyone looking for a decent pair of earphones, this is not it! Terrible sound quality. Any movement to the cable causes a lot of static. Save your money!\n",
      "Claimed to be apple earbuds.  They are not apple and they are awful quality.  They didn't even last 2 weeks.\n",
      "Wonderful just as expected\n",
      "DON'T BUY... THIS IS A MALFUNCTIONING ITEM, I JUST RECEIVED MY PACKAGE TODAY AND WAS HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED. ONLY ONE EAR PIECE WORKS. I SHOULD OF LISTEN TO THE REVIEWS BUT I TOOK A CHANCE.  IM ACTUALLY DISAPPOINTED IN AMAZON FOR ALLOWING THESE HEADPHONE TO STILL BE PURCHASED EVEN AFTER NUMEROUS BAD REVIEWS.\n",
      "One of the earpieces didn't work and I the volume button didn't work\n",
      "The microphone doesn't work with all devices. Ended up returning these and buying a different set of earbuds.\n",
      "Not authentic apple earbuds. The cord has is really thin and doesn't bend as easily. Could tell the quality wasn't the same. Better to buy at an Apple Store or at Best Buy.\n",
      "Never functioned properly, the right ear bud came with a buzz and within 1 week the left earbud stopped working entirely. Extremely disappointing and I work a full time job and find it very hard to make the time to return items.\n",
      "Poor quality.  Marketed as an Apple product, but not an Apple USA product.  A Google search on the model number shows this is either a knock-off or a product made by Apple for China.  Either way, not a quality product.  One of my earpieces crackled when the cord moved from the moment I opened it.\n",
      "You get what you pay for. These are rubbish. Don't waste your money.\n",
      "DO NOT BUY THESE THEY LASTED ME LESS THAN 1 WEEK BEFORE THEY STOPPED WORKING\n",
      "Bought a couple of them from prime electronics. Good cables. Thanks\n",
      "Ripoff..Headphone came with a blown speaker\n",
      "These do not appear to be a genuine Apple product. They have decent bass response, very muddy mids and harsh highs. If you listen to only hip hop, you might be ok with them. For full range vocals and all other kinds of music, they are not any good.\n",
      "Yup these are 100% genuine .. 100% genuine FAKES! Lol\n",
      "I usually love these, but it came broken. I can't be bothered to send it back though, so I'm just writing a negative review.\n",
      "Inauthentic product listing. Sound is considerably worse than Apple headphones\n",
      "These are NOT OEM Apple headphones. After only a few months, the microphone seems to be losing it's ability to pick up speach (unless held up to your mouth).\n",
      "Started out great but quickly started to fall apart. The top part of the button on the volume control fell off. The wire keeps coming loose from the volume control button and the headphone part as well! They still work and the price was alright but wouldn't buy again.\n",
      "Bought two replacement pairs and both were defective. The right earbud cut out and the microphone produced an ambient scratch that made conversations impossible. Don't waste your money\n",
      "They work fine .\n",
      "Fake!\n",
      "Constant static noise in the background and the right earphone sounds like its coming apart when listening to music.\n",
      "Does the job just fine\n",
      "No complaints\n",
      "You get what you pay for.\n",
      "Very good arrives on time\n",
      "Honestly dont know what happened.. one of the covers of the earpods fell off, idk what its called, and the cable feels different from the one i got when i got mine with my device, and the left one stopped working after 2 days...\n",
      "Great product no issues.\n",
      "These are fake products. The sound is very bad. The advert says made by Apple but it is not. My sister has original headsets that came with iPhone 6s and I compared the sound quality. I regret buying these.\n",
      "Received fake EarPods.\n",
      "Works perfect!\n",
      "Buy at your own risk. Have bought these from seller in the past and had no major issues but this time just received a case. Perhaps this is the new version, where you receive the essence of the earpods or you need to craft your own using the mold. Thanksfully Amazon rep refunded the $. Highly disappointed.\n",
      "Exactly what I wanted\n",
      "it works as desired and no noise and it has clear voice\n",
      "These are clearly used and or repackaged and look like they've even been taken apart to be refurbished. They are definitely not new Apple products as described in the listing. Please see included pictures taken immediately after taking them out of the packaging on an airplane ride.\n",
      "these earbuds are AMAZING!!!!!! Great base, rich sound, and you can here your friends' conversation while listening to music with them :)\n",
      "Great quality!\n",
      "fake\n",
      "Really Good and working nice.\n",
      "Apple earpods are unfortunately overpriced and break quickly. The volume buttons on these stopped working within a month or so. :-(\n",
      "Not genuine Apple ear pods. Horrible quality and not worth the money.\n",
      "Good and to standard. Keep them out of the rain\n",
      "I love them\n",
      "I've never had Apple earbuds fall apart so quickly after purchase. This followed complaints from friends who couldn't hear during phone conversations using them... then the casing around the microphone  fell off.  I've only used them less than 10 times.  There has been no rough treatment of them.  I think this is a fluke, because previous iPhone earbuds have all worked well.  Pretty disappointing though.\n",
      "All of these that I've ordered have been great.\n",
      "I opened them and one side of the earbuds didn't even work. The plastic feels cheap and I'm not pleased. O wouldn't recommend buying these.\n",
      "Perfect\n",
      "I've had these headphones for less than a month and already they don't work. First the right ear died and now the left. Poor quality, plastic feels cheap, very unlike 'new' earbuds direct from apple.\n",
      "Terrible. Broke immediately\n",
      "nice\n",
      "left side stopped working after second day of receiving these EarPods. Complete waste of money.\n",
      "Not original earpods. Dont buy.\n",
      "No problems with delivery or the earbuds. Good product for a good price.\n",
      "Thanks\n",
      "They wasn't what I expected. I assumed they were the iPhone earphones but they weren't. I still like the product but just what I expected.\n",
      "The headphones stopped working less than a month later! They made noise sometimes when I was talking on the phone. And I can't return them because I opened it. Thanks Amazon. It's sucked!\n",
      "Arrived defective, headphone cap fell off first time I took it out the package\n",
      "good quality!\n",
      "Within 1 week, only the left ear worked. Before long they broke altogether. I didn't complain or try and return it because they were inexpensive and I didn't have the time.\n",
      "earbuds work with no issues\n",
      "works good\n",
      "Perfect for my iphone\n",
      "It already broke \n",
      "My son has gone through so many earbuds! Mostly from our pets chewing them. He can't stop reading about these. He loves them\n",
      "The stereo works, it's perfect.\n",
      "These are fake!  They don't even fit properly in an iPhone 6!  This is completely deceptive.\n",
      "We purchased these for our granddaughter's birthday.  She likes them a lot so it was a good buy.\n",
      "These work \"ok\". The sound is great when its not randomly increasing or decreasing volume. They are advertised as an \"Apple\" product but I believe they could be knockoffs made to look like Apple headphones. I should have guessed by the price. Seemed a tad low for an Apple product.\n",
      "This headset was not as good as others we have purchased. One side stopped working after a month or so and now neither side works. Very disappointing.\n",
      "Absolutely not apple. Poor quality and mine shipped with a broken left ear pod.\n",
      "These headphones are the legit thing from apple, good quality and good looking, but I was expecting about more spun insulation.\n",
      "Great\n",
      "Great product.\n",
      "Love the added feature of pause, skip music.\n",
      "Good product\n",
      "This was an EXCELLENT Product!! I absolutely love these, they came on time, they sound really good they feel, look, and sound legit they are very good quality headphones!!! Money was worth it!! I 100% recommend getting a pair! Don't listen to the 1 star reviews, they are totally worth it\n",
      "DO NOT PURCHASE!! These are fake. You are better off spending an extra $5 for the real things. This is a sham and they should be reported for advertising as authentic.\n",
      "Solid headphones\n",
      "Microphone cuts in and out. Poor quality.\n",
      "Great\n",
      "PERFECT apple headphone and 2/3rds cheaper!\n",
      "Just as described and very happy with the replacement of the Apple ones that came with my cell\n",
      "Perfect\n",
      "I cannot Pause or skip music without having problems. When I pause I have to hold the middle button. I can’t skip music either.\n",
      "After two months headphone is not working!\n",
      "For the price you can't beat this headset\n",
      "Great I love them\n",
      "very nice one\n",
      "Broken after an hours use. Not authentic. What a waste of money.\n",
      "My girls love them.\n",
      "DON'T BUY THEY ARE DEFECTIVE\n",
      "It did not last a week. The speakers blew out with only 50% full volume. The wires frayed within the protective coating. Not a good deal, and avoid.\n",
      "for my son, seems to work fine.\n",
      "Terrible. Shipped broken pair.\n",
      "I've only had these things for a week or so and they're already broken.\n",
      "excellent\n",
      "Apple accessories are crap. One cuts out all the time\n",
      "didnt work. storage in one ear.\n",
      "Arrived on time and worked as described\n",
      "The only reason they get 1 star is because I couldn't go any lower. These are TOTALLY fake. The sound quality is mediocre at best and totally lacking that nice clean bass that I buy apple headphones for. Not only that I literally used them for little more than a week before the right headphone just stopped producing sound. These are absolute garbage DO NOT BUY THEM\n",
      "Broke so fast . Not one but all of them!\n",
      "good than is I want\n",
      "its a fake pod……\n",
      "These are the best earbuds I've ever listened to. The sound is perfectly clear and has lots of bass. These are definitely genuine apple earbuds.\n",
      "perfect!!!! it was present for musicant, original, great sound beter than iphons4, Sold by: A4C Online -good seller will buy again\n",
      "Amazing Earpods\n",
      "These aren't genuine apple airpods, don't buy them.\n",
      "Most likely the ones we got are the original Apple - but obviously the used ones! You can buy the used ones two times cheaper.\n",
      "Just as expected!\n",
      "Does its job perfectly.\n",
      "Knockoffs\n",
      "I BOUGHT IT. IT IS NEW AND I DID NOT USE IT YET BUT I AM EXPECTING THAT I WILL WORK. THANKS\n",
      "love it\n",
      "They are Apple earbuds which is nice for the price. Mine came with full functionality but the next few days the mic stopped working. Not too big of a deal for $12 but it's a big annoying.\n",
      "I would give you negative stars if possible.  The earpods I received are junk, sound only comes out of the left side and its terrible audio quality.\n",
      "One headphone was broken\n",
      "the remote buttons are a hard and loud click\n",
      "These are not the real apple headphones\n",
      "Liars, not apple at all\n",
      "These are not apple headphones. Find the real ones sold by Amazon/Apple directly here: https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B06X16Z7DZ/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1\n",

      "Good\n",
      "These are NOT Apple headphones, the sound quality dpes not compare to the real Apple headphones.\n",
      "Awesome! Amazing!\n",
      "I purchased without reading these reviews. These don't work. They sound fine, but the microphone doesn't work. Wish I didn't buy them\n",
      "Didn't last a week.\n",
      "Legit\n",
      "Mic doesn't work. I couldn't believe the bad reviews but it appears indeed fake.\n",
      "I use them all the time, and I love them.\n",
      "These are the best\n",
      "Just what I wanted and just what I needed\n",
      "Great buy!!\n",
      "Replacement Apple product. I am rough on these and replace them more frequently than I would like. But I haven't found anything sturdier or better suited for my kind of use (I've tried) so I always go back to these.\n",
      "I don't think this is apple genuine product. may be it is but not current version. mic part is completely different than one I got with my iPhone 6.\n",
      "the worked for a while but than they quit working\n",
      "Just as you would buy from the Apple store\n",
      "Just like the original!\n",
      "It's not the real Apple.\n",
      "It was what I wanted. Came early then I expected and works so great\n",
      "Great ear buds for the price, would definitely recommend. Primarily use for riding bike and phone calls. Good mic quality.\n",
      "Fake Product.\n",
      "it is not original earpad so, I return it I have my original damaged earpad when I compared between two both does not have same length and color are different.\n",
      "These are not authentic Apple earbuds.\n",
      "No sound in one side after only using one time.\n",
      "Received the headphones. Volume remote doesn't work. Only one headphone transfers sound.\n",
      "I wish that i can purchase this item in black. the sound is amaizing.\n",
      "The headphones were great at first, but started malfunctioning after a couple weeks.\n",
      "I bought these headphones for my iPhone as a replacement. They arrived on schedule and worked great for about 3 days and then blew up in my ear while I was using them to talk to someone on the phone. The noise actually hurt my ear for the rest of the day. They no longer function. Maybe I got a lemon, but I caution you when considering this product. I have subsequently ordered authentic apple earbuds from the Apple store and look forward to their arrival.\n",
      "all as expected\n",
      "Just got mine in the mail and they were oringinal just like in the box of a new Apple iPhone!\n",
      "These have a loud crackling noise ... very cheap\n",
      "Very disappointed.  They do not work!!!  Guess $12 was too good to be true!\n",
      "These headphones stop working within the still week I receive them\n",
      "Not a legit Apple product, mic was even on the wrong side, only one earbud worked\n",
      "Perfectly fine iPhone head phones, just like the ones you would get if you bought the phone. No knockoff\n",
      "poooo\n",
      "I didn't realize it was used. Not obviously stated on the order form.\n",
      "Seems like original Apple gear. I worry when I buy \"apple\" product in Amazon, I have been duped before. These are what I hoped for. Sound good, works good\n",
      "Great headphones, bought quickly to replace a lost one in a short period of time. Surprised to see it was not new. I thought it was not clear enough in the purchase. If i knew it was not a new product, would not have bought it. Didn't want to replace it, but am looking closer in any apple purchases at amazon from now on!\n",
      "so good\n",
      "Never bought this product, and found that somehow a review of 5 stars was written on my account. It was decently written, and believable. From the looks of other reviews they are fake. I would stay away from this product.\n",
      "Broke within days of normal use. I pulled them out of my purse (which only had my keys/wallet/phone in it) this morning to find them like this. My old official Apple headphones went through and survived much more wear and tear. My $5 bodega headphones sound like crap but have lasted longer.\n",
      "Work great, just as good as the original headphones that come with the phone.\n",
      "The ear buds were fine for the most part except that had an occasional attaching noise and they have stopped working within a month of ordering them , totally not worth the slightly cheaper price\n",
      "These are fake just got mine and could tell they were fake. Bad quality not worth the money.\n",
      "great !\n",
      "Good.\n",

      "I went to take it out of my ear and the earbud separated from the wire.\n",
      "Fake ass ear pods\n",
      "Total crap. I use these almost exclusively for work calls, and in less than 2 months they are already broken (render my phone totally useless when plugged in).\n",
      "Just like the ones that came with my phone.  Love them.\n",
      "Unfortunately the microphone did not work at all\n",
      "Worked for about 4 days, then started music will stop, speed up, skip. All forums online reference a bad headphone jack.\n",
      "These are NOT Apple earbuds.  I wrapped them and gave them to my daughter for her birthday, totally embarrassing.  I just completed my return form.\n",
      "I use the head phone for talking on the phone... that's all I really wanted them for and the microphone doesn't work like it should. I have to hold it against my mouth and even still the person on the end of the phone can barely hear me.\n",
      "Son loves them.  Thank you!!\n",
      "Fake fake fake they are not Apple they are Bappel don't be fools they're going back\n",

      "fine for my son\n",
      "Apple brand and high quality.\n",
      "Wow, these things lasted about thirty days before breaking.  Very cheap.  I bought three, and all three died after less than two months.  Choose another vendor.\n",
      "About once a year I destroy these EarPods from heavy working out in the gym. The price is great for that reason.\n",
      "Such a great replacement for the earpods that come with the iphone. Works great for me.\n",
      "Product not original and does not work to increase or decrease volume. This is false advertisement and it shouldn't have Apple brand attached to it. Very dissapointing.\n",
      "To be honest, I'm a bit skeptical whether these are actually made by Apple. They fit well and work well, but something seems just a little...off..from my original Apple headphones. As an inexpensive replacement, though, these are great!\n",
      "Great sound quality and the buds fit great in my ears.\n",
      "The earphone controller does not work\n",
      "Should've read the other reviews. Fake, cheap product. Definitely not apple earbuds. Sound is horrible.\n",
      "These came on time and work just fine.\n",
      "I like it\n",
      "Were just like actual Apple earphones, ordered them 2 weeks ago, they were just fine.\n",
      "If you have an android the volume button on these headphones will not change the volume on your device. After the wear and tear of working while using these I also noticed that the piece that plugs into the phone jack started to make crinkly static-y noises when moved. I'm used to this happening with headphones and was looking to avoid this by purchasing these name brand buds. I've had generic headphones last longer than these did. The sound quality was better than that of generic headphones I've owned though.\n",
      "They work great and are very clean. Started using them and they work great.\n",
      "I bought these and they a were delivered on Friday,6/2 and they broke on Sunday, 6/4. WTH. I am totally disappointed in this product and this is a rip off...I want my money back!!!!.....\n",
      "Original product comes in the retail hard box. Have no issues with it whatsoever.\n",
      "Thank you\n",
      "broke right away, my fault\n",
      "Awesome! A+\n",
      "The headphone wires are very cheap and feel like plastic, not the real thing.\n",
      "These headphones came with errors, sometimes the volume button doesn't work. These hadphones don't look original.\n",
      "did not work, left earbud is completely silent when plugged into my iPhone 6\n",
      "Perfect\n",
      "Not genuine Apple product ...but \"are\" the half price. so well advise if it means half the quality?  So far less quality plastic feel but sound clarity is good. They should be good as a spare as I lose these all the time..\n",
      "Microphone stopped working after less than 2 weeks. Definitely not real!\n",
      "Ordered these a bunch of times. Work great! Just like when you get a brand new pair with a brand new iPhone!\n",
      "These work great with my iPhone. I would buy them again.\n",
      "Fake ass earphones. I want a refund\n",
      "ty\n",
      "Nice, good product!\n",
      "still hurt my ears\n",
      "awesome\n",
      "Appears to be a knock-off.  Did not work properly right out of the package.  Material of construction was flimsy; wire thickness is more like the old style of Apple headphones and not the ones of this style, which are thicker for true OEM.\n",
      "Stopped working after a month\n",
      "Great ear buds! Highly recommend\n",
      "They are as great as the ones they come with the Iphone originally. It was totally worth it and they are cheaper than the ones selling in the -all know the brand- store website. So if you are looking for headphones for your apple products this are good option.\n",
      "Good product\n",
      "IT IS LIKE THE ORIGINAL. GOOD QUALITY.\n",
      "They broke after one use. I returned for a refund. These are not actual Apple headphones. Buy at your own risk.\n",
      "Works cool.\n",
      "There are questions whether or not these are real Apple headphones. Even if they are not they look and feel very similar to the actual. Sound quality? I have a very nice pair of over-the-ear headphone that no in-the-ear buds will compare. They sound great for the price! As for the microphone, it performs loud and clear. So, if these are replica headphones, they are top notch replicas.\n",
      "Good quality and good sound. Great price\n",
      "Bud that goes in ear is not soft...Works as expected but was disappointed when I noticed no volume control on mic.\n",
      "One side stopped working only after a month.\n",
      "FAKE!!! USELESS\n",
      "Lasted only 2 months and sound was no longer playing\n",
      "A decent pair of headphones\n",
      "Love them\n",
      "Work great!\n",
      "Not worth it,i just got these and the right earbud is already cut off from sound\n",
      "Just what I needed and very fast delivery!!!\n",
      "They worked great:\n",
      "Bought item in February one bud not working by May. Rip off!\n",
      "Id bet twice what I spent on this that it's not an apple product. It shorts out whenever I touch the cord, and the cord doesn't feel like the original material used by Apple. Very annoyed that I have to go to UPS to return this garbage.\n",
      "Work well!\n",
      "nothing special to say... they are standard apple headphones.\n",
      "Great price on a pair of apple headphones\n",
      "Came in original Apple packaging. Sound is great, works like a charm. Thank you!!\n",
      "Was defective but Apple Store exchanged one for another which worked great!\n",
      "Great deal original parts\n",
      "Love it\n",
      "Thanks\n",
      "Even when the case was fully charged, it still was super slow to charge my phone. Also, I've had it for three days and I can no longer put my phone in the case to charge, the lightning cable extension that plugs into my phone is busted. It happened while attempted to get the phone out of the case.\n",
      "Works as advertised\n",
      "I use these all the time....especially from my computer so i don't disturb other family members....Although I can hear from them, I wish the sound were a little clearer because it is difficult to hear when there is outside noise.\n",
      "replaced headphones that came with the iphone\n",
      "These arrived in perfect condition.  They are original apple earpods.  Recommend the purchase\n",
      "As expected.\n",
      "I have used for about 30 days and one ear bud has stopped working.\n",
      "Purchased 4/12/17 and use all day every day. Worked great for 1 month when the left ear failed. I expected more than 1 month out of this item - annoying. Into the trash they go.\n",
      "Excellent ear pods. I use them every day.\n",
      "/Right channel was non-functional. Returned for refund (which was handled promptly!).\n",
      "My daughter love this head phones but to me the stop working after 2 months\n",
      "Thanks so much! These headphones work great. Authentic Apple product. Now I don't have to hear my kids' music!\n",
      "These headphones get three stars from me. The quality of Apple headphones are the best with the base in the ear buds. Only problem I have to say with this product is my mic will work sometimes and sometimes it won't. So at times I can't change the volume or pause a song. Overall ear buds still work perfect and the base quality of these are amazing\n",
      "These ear buds are amazing! I had to get new ones, because my last ones were from the ipod 5. The sound quality and bass are perfect, and I am very impressed. People can't hear them playing when you're wearing them and it's nice. I want to clarify after reading some reveiws, they ARE APPLE AND ARE CLEAN. I definitely recommend these to all.\n",
      "These are fake as fuuuuuuuuuuck\n",
      "Not real Apple speakers. Don't buy.\n",
      "Not truly apple headphones. Deceiving title. Cheap version\n",
      "Opens my Apple Music app itself and stops working when it wants to\n",
      "Very disappointed. My son ordered these and received them April 20th. He used them for 2 weeks and already one earpiece does not work.\n",
      "I just received this yesterday and started using it this morning and this item is faulty.  None of the remote buttons work (volume +/1, pause/play, etc.)  There's probably a reason why resellers do not charge anywhere near the $29 retail prices that Apple charges.  While this item looks to be an original Apple part with the Apple part number \"MD827LL/A\" it's hard for me to believe that Apple would really allow a faulty item to pass through inspection.  I was either just unlucky and got the one bad apple, or apple unloads all of it's \"2nd quality\" items at reduced rates to resellers and resellers then sell them to customers, or maybe it's a fake, or possibly this was sold as new but isn't really new.  Whatever the case, I'm returning asap.  It would be awesome for someone to test these items before shipping to customers so we don't have to deal with the annoyance of sending back a bad product.\n",
      "One earphone stopped working after 10 days, the other has just died after 3 weeks. These obviously aren't refurbished to a high standard. I would spend the extra on New Apple Headphones - really disappointed\n",
      "They didn't work from the second I received them\n",
      "Amazing sound quality. Item as described\n",
      "These are replacements for my son's headphones. They work great.\n",
      "it is what is says it is.\n",
      "Yep, this is not real apple, but the sound  quality is not bad at all among counterfeit ones, but still not as good as real apple ones.\n",
      "cool\n",
      "I bought this headphones and shortly after purchasing the right EarPod blew out and never worked again. Very annoying to have to listen to music through 1 side\n",
      "It not even working NOISY AUDIO, mic not even working.\n",
      "They worked great for 4 months then quit working.\n",
      "They Broke two weeks after packaging it :(\n",
      "Good\n",
      "These are fake and sound like crap, I have 2 pairs of real Apple earbuds to compare these too.\n",
      "Typical\n",
      "As soon as I opened the packaging I noticed what I hoped to be chocolate inside the case and packaging of the new headphones I brought.\n",
      "Love this product! Quality as described~\n",
      "Fake earphones\n",
      "Do not waste your time and money! One side is not working at all from day one.\n",
      "Simple, nice sound quality \n",
      "POS cheap and flismy garbage\n",
      "Exactly what I expected. This was not an oration product.\n",
      "Make sure you check your seller before buying! In my experience I went through OEM Battery Supply and I received them brand new and they are official!\n",
      "Were just as they were advertised, 100% legit, came in original packaging\n",
      "Excellent\n",
      "Seems like the real deal\n",
      "These didn't even last a month.  I've only had them for three weeks and the left ear pod is broken.  No sound comes out of the left ear pod...at all.  Definitely not Apple quality as advertised!\n",
      "Just what I expected thanks\n",
      "They broke after 2 days\n",
      "As advertised.\n",
      "Amazon if your reading this I return these head phones months ago and now you what to charge my credit card again!\n",
      "Not original, the part that plugs on the phone kinda broke after 1 week\n",
      "Had these in my cart but based on all the negative reviews I changed my mind so much people couldn't be lying.\n",
      "The control button never worked. It makes a weird noise when I try to control the volume or pause/play songs.\n",
      "EarPods came in with one cracked and a clump of dirt inside of it. Also requested to buy a brand new one and it did not look new at all.\n",
      "Headphones stopped working -- and it's just 10 days after the return period.  Not impressed at all.  (minimum word count)\n",
      "They're have great sound.  I've tried many different types and have found nothing so far as good as these.  Definitely recommend.\n",
      "Bought these for my son. He only used a few times and they are no longer working. The sounds cut off. Missed my return window by 2 days.\n",
      "Great headphones however, $15.00 these particular headphones were a bit overpriced.  Walmart sells them for 10.\n",
      "It is not Original Apple product. It broke after 15 days. Don't buy this one. You will regret soon. Go buy the original from Apple shop or online if you want to have the original. Because this one is fake one.\n",
      "These things are original an works great...love mine!! Paid $15 for an original thats a deal lol...love it\n",
      "The first time I opened the product and used it, the casing around the plug came off. I just can't trust any seller on here.\n",
      "they broke after 2 weeks\n",
      "Amazing!\n",
      "When I first got it it seamed fine. I used it nearly every week for about a month, but randomly half way through a song, the left earbud stopped playing sound. I tried multiple methods, but I could not get it to work again. You're better off getting a Bluetooth headset.\n",
      "Terrible and fake\n",
      "I was excited when received the package, it looked like the original package and sounded excellent for the first 3 weeks!  Then I could only listen from one ear bud and they died!\n",
      "I used these for all of a week and the left earphone stopped working, and then the cover fell open somehow and i saw one of the wires inside had snapped. Confused as to how that happened considering I kept them in good condition and only had them for a week.\n",
      "junk, don't bother\n",
      "Obviously very fake. After 2 weeks of use, each pair of earbuds lost connection in one ear. The quality is pretty bad, but of course, you get what you pay for.\n",
      "they work very very well\n",
      "Not the real apple earphones. They went out after a week of use\n",
      "Broke after a month and a half... now only one earbud works. Super bummed.\n",
      "They did not work for me.\n",
      "Great and quality headphones\n",
      "Perfect!\n",
      "perfect\n",
      "These aren't superb or anything but they work just fine. I don't care very much about music quality and mostly use these for listening to audiobooks or talking on the phone, and nobody on the other end of the phone has ever reported problems with the mic. They're fine for the price, especially as I am picky about having volume controls, a pause button, and a mic all on the cord as this one has. Unlike $5 or $10 pairs I have bought on amazon before, they've lasted a decent length of time. I think I've had them for about half a year.\n",
      "They Broke Apart In Less Than 2-Weeks! Missed The Return Window\n",
      "They came really fast and they work great. Thank you so much.\n",
      "After using only a few weeks, no sound in the right earbud.\n",
      "good\n",
      "Best headphones for this price\n",
      "they broke in 2 days\n",
      "I purchased these earbuds around April 3 and I am so upset because just five minutes ago one of the bud is not working. So disappointed. I have never had to give amazon a bad review but I'm frustrated\n",
      "My daughter insisted on Apple earbuds because she loved the fit and ability to use the switch on the cord. Her first set lasted a year, this set lasted 2 weeks. The plug insert thing broke when unplugging from iPod.\n",
      "If I could give no stars I would\n",
      "I strongly recommend you DONT buy this product. These earphones are not original Apple products. I bought it twice to realise that it was the product that was not original. Each time, i got a pair of these, they would work fine for a month, then one side would stop working, and then eventually would stop working. Do not buy this product, it's a scam!\n",
      "I'm happy with the article\n",
      "the mic is soooo bad\n",
      "They started to act up after like a few days. The sound wouldn't come out right. After a few days you need to play with the cord a little for the sound to play right.\n",
      "Works like original one\n",
      "Excellent!\n",
      "These earbuds barely worked to start with and then broke within a week. First the left earbud gave off a buzzing sound, then just completely stopped working. NOT worth the bargain!\n",
      "The left side is louder than the right spud so it was uneven. I couldn't use them\n",
      "Great earbuds. They work just like my other Apple earbuds.\n",
      "Great Apple product!\n",
      "Thank you!\n",
      "Terrible!  They came broken in the box.  As some as I picked it up I could see the plug was not attached. Junk.\n",
      "These sound TERRIBLE. I'd rather listen to my music through a cup and string.\n",
      "broke after a few weeks\n",
      "These headphones fell apart during their very first use. Firstly, one of the speakers didn't even work, and then--when my son placed his phone in his pocket, and went to put them in his ears, the wires just slipped right out! DO NOT BUY these headphones! They are not worth what they are charging, and are horrible quality. There's no way these are actual Apple headphones--I've never had such a bad experience with genuine Apple products in the past.\n",
      "Great deal. These are a solid pair of earpods.  Sound quality is very good for for this price point. Would recommend to anyone looking for a good quality affordable pair of earbuds.\n",
      "Fake\n",
      "not my favorite.\n",
      "Do not purchase. They came out of the box muffled. One week later, the left airbud went all together. Spend a little more for the authentic Apple product rather than be disappointed with these.\n",
      "Only one ear bud worked after a couple weeks worth of use. I returned them and went to apple to get the real deal.\n",
      "Buttons did not work on arrival. Do not appear to be genuine.\n",
      "These stopped working after just a couple of weeks.\n",
      "EarPods was broken on arrival, couldn't connect input plug because it was bent\n",
      "Really unbeatable for price until you delve into Chinese headphones.\n",
      "Great sound\n",
      "This product came damaged with wires exposed. It was not slightly used.\n",
      "I am cheap, so I don't like spending this much money for headphones, but Apple headphones fit in my ears better than any other brand I've tried.\n",
      "Like it a lot\n",
      "Works just as good as the ones that came with my iphone!\n",
      "One ear died in a month.\n",
      "My son dropped them and the left earpod split in 2! It's not that heavy of an object that it should split in 2...he was sitting on his bed...must be cheap quality or refurbished, not sure.\n",
      "THE thing didn't last a good two weeks. The right earbud stopped working and the mic was defective. Both the pairs i bought were a WASTE OF MONEY\n",
      "send to my friend as gift\n",
      "When I got them I could hear music out of them but I couldn't use them for phone calls no one could hear me they said all they heard was static so I ended up buying some headphones from walmart.\n",
      "Broke in a week.\n",
      "A bit pricey, but work very well.\n",
      "It works great thanks\n",
      "After 3 days, the pods did not work anymore. Not real apple headphones and a very cheap imitation.\n",
      "you get what you expect. great!\n",
      "It stopped working a day after! I would love to replace them.\n",
      "work well\n",
      "Junk! they broke within days of regular usage,\n",
      "Great\n",
      "Love these EarPods! Had to order another pair cuz my daughter took them cuz she likes them so much lol. Great quality!\n",
      "Everytime I buy this, after only about 4 weeks one or both of the ear buds stop working and it's so freaking frustrating.\n",
      "Headphones broke a few months later. Can only hear out of one ear. Would not buy.\n",
      "This was a completel waste of my time. It doesn't even work. I wish I could give a rating of zero. Now I have to worry about finding a printer to print the return label and then return. I needed this for my vacation flight but it didn't work. Total BS\n",
      "great\n",
      "Good\n",
      "These work perfectly! Love them!\n",
      "They work well.\n",
      "Product didn't work.\n",
      "The volume keys don't work, everything else is fine.\n",
      "These headphones couldn't be used for talking to someone. They would always complain that I sound \"far away\" or \"mumbled\" ( it was NOT my phone seeing as how I would unplug them and the sound would be fine)...Then I began using them just for music and one day the ear bud just popped off..The worst pair of headphones I've ever owned. I'll just go back to the Apple Store..\n",
      "The sound is absolutely terrible and these are not real apple headphones.\n",
      "they came in broken\n",
      "Not a great product. One ear stopped working in less than a week\n",
      "It's great the shipment was quick and the headphones work absolutely fantastic\n",
      "They looked fine upon arrival. After two days one of the buds stopped working! And it hasn't worked since.\n",
      "Great product for a great price\n",
      "These are not true Apple product. They broke after a few days.\n",
      "was perfect\n",
      "Got these earbuds or my grandson. He was very pleased with them. Great quality and great sound.\n",
      "The product is as described in the picture. This one arrived in the right time and without any mishaps. I recommend it. Bought from Medellin, Colombia.\n",
      "The microphone did not work. This was the whole reason I purchased them. I emailed the company to have them replaced and never heard back. Very disappointed.\n",
      "Everything I expected it to be.\n",
      "Perfect\n",
      "Worked just like the original earbuds\n",
      "Incredibly perfect! I'm gonna shopping it again!\n",
      "The earphones work sometimes n then they don't n the port does not fit into the port cause I have to take my cover off my phone so I will just not use these anymore\n",
      "Just as described!\n",
      "It broke very quickly because the material was not strong\n",
      "Bought (2) \"apple\" earpods - They both broke after using a handful of times.  The first time i thought it was a product fluke, but when it happened w/ the second pair i realized it was a product issue.  Our apple earpods last months and I suspect these are not true apple products and/or are refurbished.\n",
      "barely worked. highly disappointed\n",
      "It is just what I wanted to go with my phone.\n",
      "Exactly what you think it is, it does. Just, don't wash them or run them over. Typical stuff.\n",
      "The right headphone was broken right when i bought it complete waste of money and i bought with amazon prime\n",
      "Meets expectations\n",
      "Most excellent. It serves my audio needs to a T.\n",
      "It stopped working 2 days later! Will never buy this item again nor any product from this seller again. Disappointed\n",
      "Ok I thought this product is authentic, but we can see this is not, since the control buttons does not work 50% of time, and are too stiff than authentic one\n",
      "So I was a bit hesitant after buying these headphone cause of all the bad reviews but I got them today and they are pretty good felt new and had good hearing honestly pretty shocked I compared them to my new Apple headphones from the Apple Store and they are the exact same.\n",
      "Horrible, not made by Apple and they broke after a day but you get what you pay for\n",
      "These were out of the package and not new ws advertised.\n",
      "Very good quality earphones\n",
      "Great quality.\n",
      "I bought 2 headphones and both of them were defective. Only the right ear pod was working. Could not hear anything from the left ear pod. Clearly these are not authentic Apple pods and are cheap knockoffs with really poor quality.\n",
      "Literally last me for about almost a year and very aggressive with my headphones most or the time, but these were amazing\n",
      "My right earbud stopped working :/\n",
      "Great sound.\n",
      "Don't buy from these people\n",
      "Arrived quickly and as expected.  Works great!\n",
      "good\n",
      "These worked ok for about 3 months, then the volume went haywire; off and on it would blare loudly and unexpectedly.  Tried to return but \"return period expired\", which may be an auto-reply based on how quickly the response came back (20 minutes).  The device and packaging appear to be Apple, but one wonders...  I do not recommend.\n",
      "Right earbud broke within first day of use. Chances are, they're fake.\n",
      "Original equipment\n",
      "Worst soent money ever, didn't last for more than 3 weeks. Arrived defective (issue which seller never solved). Really bad quality for it's price, which is the same price as the original.\n",
      "Despite the package being 2 days late, it still managed to have it nicely packed and the earphones work great, I've tried using the control button and it works fine. I would definitely buy this product again if in case I would ever need a new one\n",
      "The sound on these is fine, but the mic and control seem to be unresponsive when I try to skip or pause music. I don't know if that's how they were supposed to turn out because they're not the official Apple headphones or if I got faulty ones.\n",
      "fits nice does the job\n",
      "Stop working after one use :-( very disappointed\n",
      "this is the other waste of my hard earned money! and you would think since they come from apple, i would get a little more satisfaction! all i can say is that apple has alot of people bambozzeled  it doesn't make me wanting to jump on the apple bandwagon\n",
      "The product doesn't work anymore\n",
      "One of them you can hear but anthoer you cant i think they are not the origenial they dont work there trash\n",
      "Apple earphones are by far my favorite.\n",

      "This time I believe these earbuds were Apple products.\n",
      "Extaclty what it says in the decription.\n",
      "Not sure those are really Apple product. They did not feel right and people had problems hearing me well during calls.\n",
      "Out of the box one of the headphones did not work :( unfortunately did not save the box.\n",
      "The right earphone stopped working after a month.\n",
      "Not a good purchase. After exactly 1 month of buying them (and taking extra good care of them) these headphones broke. They started playing more bass and less voice than normal. DO NOT RECOMMEND\n",
      "The remote/microphone stopped working after less than 2 months. I've never had these type of issues with headphones so quickly.\n",
      "NOT REAL APPLE PRODUCT.  These feel cheaper, and the sound is terrible.  Do not waste your money.\n",
      "Good sound and volume control for the price. Stereo and microphone works well as well. Value for the price.\n",
      "The earpods arrived with the volume control cover off. I pushed it back on and so far it's staying and working.\n",
      "GARBAGE\n",
      "Good sound!\n",
      "Bought these exact headphones 2 years ago from apple products never had a complaint my old ones messed up about 2 months ago got these new ones perfect sound all around.\n",
      "These are real apple headphones. I was a bit hesitant to order them since others have had bad experiences but these are real\n",
      "These are terrible headphones. They are fake and something is wrong with the sound control on them, so when they are plugged into my iPhone my music stops every 15-45 seconds cause it thinks I am trying to use voice control or talk to Siri. Do not buy.\n",
      "Only one side of the earbuds worked\n",
      "Within no more then five minutes after first using them, the left earbud stopped working.\n",
      "Headphones worked great\n",
      "my grand-daughter is enjoying them\n",
      "Product as described, Delivered on time.\n",
      "Great quality\n",

      "The left ear phone is broken. I can only hear things out of the right ear.\n",
      "Stopped working after a month of use.\n",
      "There knock offs. Not to bad. Mic works sometimes\n",
      "as expected.came on time\n",
      "I got these Friday and Monday morning they already don't work.\n",
      "work great, son loves them.  Great price, quick delivery\n",
      "Did not work\n",
      "EarPods stopped working within a week\n",
      "totally fake, cheap, nothing to do with apple, ripoff.  these people can go to hell.  you can seriously get better headphones from the airlines when you watch movies on a plane.\n",
      "the earphone on the right blew out during my third day of using the product. I was really upset considering the reliability I had with my old pair of apple ear pods.\n",
      "Both headphones caused crackling when speaking right out of the packaging. No other headphones in the same device caused this issue. DO NOT PURCHASE!\n",
      "They broke my son didn't like them\n",
      "I bought this ear piece and the left side does not work.  I was sent a defective pair.\n",
      "Normal\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm happy with the pods.\n",
      "Very pleased with this purchase.\n",
      "cost too much\n",
      "I bought two pair. Microphones didn't work. Remotes didn't work. Part that plugs into the jack broke off within one week.\n",
      "Just has described and has worked well with all the teenager abuse. lol\n",
      "I got this product delivered on March 7th and today is March 30th the right bud has stop working. It just suddenly stopped working.\n",
      "I was not happy with these headphones at all. I don't like spending $22 and not being satisfied with the product. I would like an email back or something. Need to be fixed.\n",
      "Awesome earphones cant find them anywhere anymore if you do they would cost you a lot moree too\n",
      "ORDERED 2 \"Apple\" headsets. Both were defective. Poor service and a waste of time.\n",
      "Authentic apple ear buds. Work perfectly!\n",
      "Just received them\n",
      "Not Authentic. Don't bother!\n",
      "Right earbud stopped working after 1 month\n",
      "I am not happy with these headphones at all. Once I received them, they were low for about two days and just stopped working out of the blue. They don't have a blemish and they had no damage done to them since they came. I would like to be fully refunded or sent a replacement.\n",
      "One of the headphones wasn't working...\n",
      "Ordered a pair and only the right ear bud worked\n",
      "Really good headphones at a great price. Great job apple\n",
      "Compare to my original ear bud this product feel little weak of sound and make noise when you moving the wire.\n",
      "Broke already\n",
      "These are NOT apple earbuds. The mic doesn't work, the wire quality makes it tangle. These are imposters of the real deal. Do not buy\n",
      "Solid earphones. Plays the music very well. I haven't had any problems.\n",
      "Broke easily\n",
      "These are really nice headphones - I can never find any that don't hurt my ears. These are very comfortable. I love the volume changer. It is so tiny and easy to click up for louder and down for quieter. I'll be buying more sets.\n",
      "Everything OK (The package was too big for a little box).\n",
      "Normal use and they just stopped working.\n",
      "Came broken. The volume/mic piece was crushed\n",
      "Main con is that they're too bulky. If you use them to sleep while watching something on your phone or tablet, they hurt the hell out of your ears. Other than that they're fine I guess. Well they also fall out a lot and don't stay in place cause they're so big. I miss the normal apple earphones previous to these but you can only find chinese knockoffs.\n",
      "Accidentally ran these headphones through the washer and dryer twice without realizing they in my jeans. The first time they were washed, I was pretty impressed to find that they still worked. After they were washed and dried the second time, I was amazed to find that they still work and still sound good. The cord is a little kinked but over all, still going strong. Definitely worth the money.\n",
      "Throughly enjoying my new ear buds. I repeatedly buy Apple's headphones because I like the fit better than traditional round and rubber ear buds. They feel nicer and although they aren't Beats quality ear buds, all of my music sounds great. My overall rating for these is a 5 star. 10/10. Good job Apple!\n",
      "Microphone has already stopped working and it's not even 3 months. Do I need to take it to nearby apple store for replacement?\n",
      "I question if these are actually Apple - as they feel much lesser quality than actual Apple buds and they are awful on the hearing and speaking technical aspect. From day 1 people could hardly hear me and said  sounded really far away and my voice kept coming in and out. BRW\n",
      "Great product\n",
      "They broke after a couple of days very disappointed. Not worth the money\n",
      "I am pleased with this product. Thank you.\n",
      "Wow, they are absolutely horrible.  Came today, plugged in and all static, crackling.  I have to believe they are knock off and NOT Apple ear buds.  Sending back today.\n",
      "Headphones came in a legit apple headphones package, taped and everything. quality of music is very good and has amazing bass just like the ones that came with my iphone. Definitely recommend if you're trying to replace broke headphones for a cheaper price!!!\n",
      "They are good!!?\n",
      "They're fake. Not genuine apple earbuds. They sound like garbage. I feel like I'm listening to music on an old radio 20 feet away from me.\n",
      "100% apple\n",
      "Broke in a week.\n",
      "These headphones are very high quality!\n",
      "Work great, but won't work with newest iPhone!\n",
      "These are really good knock offs, if you have good ears for sound you can tell the difference right away.\n",
      "It is good\n",
      "I got this for my boyfriend after he broke his and they work really good!\n",
      "Very Good !!!\n",
      "They stopped working after 1 day \n",
      "Was in absolute need of new headphones, these were affordable and are excellent quality. Will be ordering an extra pair!\n",
      "\n",
      "Good as originals\n",
      "Brought two pairs of these headphones. Within one week both of the right ear buds stopped working within that week. I would not recommend buying these.\n",
      "Immediate issues out of the box. Poor quality. My recommendation is to just directly from the Apple website or go with a different aftermarket product.\n",
      "I had to return these earphones after one earbud broke after only a few days of use. Something in the earbud must have come loose, because it began to buzz, and became increasingly worse. Very disappointed since I thought that an Apple product would be of much better quality.\n",
      "The cheapest headphones ever!! Didn't even last a month and this is not the first time I've purchased these headphones. Learned my lesson and won't purchase again\n",
      "As expected\n",
      "I got exactly what was advertised and the headphones also worked. They were in its original case (apple case) as well.\n",
      "good\n",
      "Great gift for a teen.\n",
      "A day late. But it also came with a free case. Works good so far. So I'm pleased.\n",
      "Amazing deal!\n",
      "Came in original apple package sound the same even better they are half the price of the apple ones in stores\n",
      "Accidentally broke my original pair that I've had forever. I literally feel incomplete when I'm out and about and don't have my headphones with me. Arrived on time and works great as the pair that broke.\n",
      "These are backup pods, which work exactly as expected.\n",
      "I ordered two and both didn't work.  The Seller did at least refund my money.\n",
      "The ones I received were not apple. They appeared to be fake/knockoffs. I will be returning these.\n",
      "Can't complain, they are great!\n",
      "They are fake but will suffice sound ok for now\n",
      "Horrible!!! Plugged them in and no sound!!!!! Controls work but not the sound extremely disappointed!\n",
      "Timely shipping, excellent audio quality.\n",
      "As advertised.  Buy it!\n",
      "IT WAS BROKEN; IT DOESN'T WORK. CALLERS CAN'T HEAR ME; I CAN'T HEAR CALLERS.\n",
      "These earpods shocked me while they were in my ear. Poorly made.\n",
      "Just what was listed and needed\n",
      "They stopped working after the first 30 minutes of use!\n",
      "I was nervous after all the reports of fake product, but mine were authentic!\n",
      "HD, brand new, and fits my ears. Good replacement for the ones I lost. These are amazing! I love the tips too, because they aren't weird like the ones Beats have that are squishy. Though I will miss the headphone jack then I have to get a new electronic that has no earphone jack. Why Apple and Samsung?\n",
      "Actual Factory EarPods with apple box and everything. If you want the same as the ones that came with your apple device these are for you.\n",
      "Working well; arrived on time!!\n",
      "Maybe it was my luck, or I don't know, but I do know that these AirPods broke within a 2 days after I received them. I would not recommend for anyone to purchase this item for that reason, and for the fact that they are not original. Not only that, but if you are going to sell a fake, which is understandable, at least make it a good quality item.\n",
      "Too short of a cord for use at the gym or if your phone is in your pocket. Also, the remote control piece came not fully sealed and broke apart within the first day, so now my wires are exposed.\n",
      "Sounds great, love the bass! But remote buttons aren't working and I have an iPhone 5s\n",
      "I have high suspicion that these are not authentic Apple headphones. Maybe I missed something in the description, not sure. I bought 2 pairs at different times, and both developed connection issues after 4-5 weeks of light use. I have to wiggle headphone in jack back and forth to get clear, scrathch-less sound. I went as far as check my phone jack, and no issues were found. Same issues are found when connecting to my Mac and iPad. I bought the same headphones from the Apple store and no issues with them 3 months into their life.\n",
      "Authentic apple EarPods. Worth the money!\n",
      "Great replacement for lost headphones that came with my iPhone.\n",
      "excelent\n",
      "I do not recommend. These do not have the same quality as those that come inside of the iPhone boxes. They broke within the first month of receiving them. They can easily be put back together, but why are they falling apart in the first place. I do not recommend this product.\n",
      "good product\n",
      "They broke the first week and the output quality of the headphones are horrible. This was my first time experience and i will never comeback to buy them,  i wasted money on a products that broke the 5th time i used it\n",
      "Not a genuine product. Knockoff that doesn't even look authentic and works poorly.  This item should be removed from Amazon as false advertising\n",
      "In less than 10 days I had no sound coming in my right ear. The wire is more rigid or less flexible than the previous one and I think that it's the reason it didn't hold as well in my ear.\n",
      "Honestly, they are good lmbo. Clean, neatly packaged. Legit.\n",
      "One month of use and still doing well.\n",
      "I'm extremely disappointed to have received EarPods with a defective left earbud. When I use the earbuds, I can hear something jangling around in the left bud and the sound cuts in and out. For the price, this is extremely disappointing, and I will not be ordering this product again or recommending it to anyone else. Buyer beware.\n",
      "Very satisfied.\n",
      "IT IS FAKE!!!!\n",
      "fake earbuds dont buy\n",
      "I like them dude.\n",
      "I can't say to much cause I lost : /\n",
      "Nice\n",
      "REALLY POOR OUTPUT\n",
      "I read the review that if it is sold directly by Amazon, it will be genuine. That made sense to me. Well, I just received mine today, sold by Amazon and not some 3rd party fulfilled by Amazon. First thing I noticed is how kinked the cords are. I immediately put my original Apple Earbuds and this new one side by side for comparison and sure enough, the new one had flimsy, thin chords. Not only that, there's a severe pinch leaving it permanently bent (see the photos). The sound also didn't come through until I jiggled the plug several times. I took a chance, hoping the product I receive is as good as my original, but that was not the case.\n",
      "Terrible! Broke after 3 days of use. Wondering if this was fake but considering the high price!\n",
      "Didn't work, connector bad, forgot to send back and didn't really have time to mess with it for $12.\n",
      "fake\n",
      "great\n",
      "Just like the ones from Apple.  Only giving 4 stars because they're expensive...\n",
      "The headphone jack is too small and falls out of all devices. As soon as you move it unplugs itself and you cannot use it. Very disappointed!\n",
      "Just to push you I'll give you guys four starts the RC plugs feel different easy pop out to easy not all the way in so the spike umm I see what you're doing and would do the same so fingers can only  force themselves in and fall out not a hand shake unfortunately this round was PC and I miss my Mac book and the way you guys hold you're base software last Lenovo I was looking for keyboard space at a price easy but you pay the price of the price so I have headphones and we will see where I go from here to hold outside the red snapper and spin clean in the giroscope technology dubbed to far to play chopper just saying it's more magic than science all I have to say keep trying to explain that I'll say it again to\n",
      "Good quality fake or original, but sounds good.\n",
      "When I received the headphones, they were already broken. One ear did not work. My second time buying and the first time was the same scenario.\n",
      "The listing says Apple, but these are not genuine. They are cheap imitations with Apple branding. Returned these and went directly to Apple for a replacement.\n",
      "Cool deal.\n",
      "Not sure about the rest, as I mostly see bad reviews, but they worked for me. Don't care if they are authentic or not, they worked, looked and felt like the real deal.\n",
      "They broke on the first day! :(\n",
      "So far so good, I've only had it for a day. They took a about 5 days longer to arrive but they work great with my I-pod. I'm not sure if they are actual I phone head phones but they do the trick.\n",
      "Has been working great\n",
      "IMHO if you make sure you order from Amazon, you will get the real thing. They don't always have them, and I have seen the price vary by about $9, but mine seem real. Had a plastic case, manual, faint grey markings on cable and an outer, unopened box. I really liked the fit of the new style that came with my phone, wanted these to replace the old iPod style, to use with the iPod and iPad. Plus they don't need foams that rip and fall off. I haven't tested the mic on a phone call, but that isn't important to me. I rarely answer a call when wearing them, mostly at work. They have about 10 functions, that work on the iPad, not the iPod, including FF, RW, skip, volume, pause, phone, call waiting and they will snap a pic if the camera is open. I use them regularly to pause, beats waking the iPad and pausing, then doing the same to unpause. I wish they were a little longer, they are the same length as the old style with my iPod, the new ones with the lightening plug are about 4\" longer. No problems so far with about 2 weeks of daily use.\n",
      "Not real. Broke in a week. Don't buy!!!\n",
      "I lose these every two seconds so who knows how long they last but they sound much better and fit in your ear better than almost everything on the market under 120\n",
      "one of them doesn't work at all, the other one stopped to work after one week \n",
      "Do not buy these!! I didn't read the reviews b/c I assumed from the product description that they were actually Apple brand earbuds. But they are not. They come in the apple earbud case, but the moment you unwind them you can tell they aren't authentic. The weight of the wire is lighter and the buttons on the earbud cords don't always work. The audio quality is poor as well.\n",
      "Excellent\n",
      "Horrible the headphone broke less than a week\n",
      "Great iPhone ear buds.\n",
      "Perfect and work...as always\n",

      "Good I guess nothing fancy dont last long\n",
      "These headphones shock my ears when I remove the connection to my iPhone. Also the microphone died within 1 week. Bit of a scam I would say.\n",
      "broke within 1 month, poorly constructed\n",
      "good copy but awful sound quality\n",
      "Thank you\n",
      "Great product, easy to use.\n",
      "It worked for 3 days and then stopped working. Will try to return the product. I am very much disappointed.\n",
      "As expected\n",
      "These are fake headphones. Do not buy it's obvious they repackaged unauthentic earpods into Apple packaging.\n",
      "Stopped working very quickly. Obviously fake; not an Apple product. Do not buy.\n",
      "They were terrible I wound up throwing them in the trash. Please don't sell those things to nobody else I feel like I got scammed. I know most things on Amazon is good quality this is the only thing that I have purchased that was really bad.\n",
      "Look and feel like apple ear pods, sound like them, but came with a short in the wire where they connect to the phone\n",
      "These are fake, not Apple. Stopped working completely after 1-2 weeks.\n",
      "Exactly what I needed.  Replacement Apple ear pods.  My last set broke when I wheeled over them in my office chair.  These have really held up and I would definitely purchase them again.\n",
      "I couldn't believe such good quality EarPods were so cheap\n",
      "Over the top, didn't think they would work so well.  I took a chance and bought 3 pair for Christmas gifts and wow. Thank you....beats $30.00 for the same ones at Best Buy!!!\n",
      "Would give 0 stars but I can't . Ever wet earphones & tested to see if they work but when you test them they have no bass this is exactly what I got . So if your interested in no bass bootleg apple earphones go ahead & purchase them \n",
      "Just opened these and they were working fine then suddenly starting popping. Won't buy again from this seller.\n",
      "Works good\n",
      "It has been 2 weeks and they stopped working suddenly while sitting on the bus. They seemed used when I got them, but had decent quality. Definitely not worth buying.\n",
      "Ehhh.... Watch out for the fake ones.\n",
      "Good quality headphones.\n",
      "Work great!\n",
      "Sound button is not very easy to use\n",
      "I bought these because I couldn't find mine that came with my phone.  Before these arrived my old ones turned up so I didn't use try these for a couple of months.  When I finally did try them, from the moment I plugged them in I heard static.  I've tried them in my phone, ipod, laptop and several other devices with the same results - static!\n",
      "The pair I received were clearly fake, dirty, and very cheap quality. Very disappointed, will be buying directly from the Apple Store from now on.\n",
      "Fake but sounds slightly better than most fakes. Ill stick to apple store and walmart for apple earbuds ftom now on.\n",
      "Perfect\n",
      "Bought several pair for my daily and they work perfect and last a long time. Thank you\n",
      "Very good product!\n",
      "High quality and works very well\n",
      "When I rate the male end while it's in the phone, they make a loud crackling sound.  There is also a LOT of static.\n",
      "didnt last long\n",
      "Either inauthentic or not as described a fit for IPhone 6. There's so much noise when the connector is touched upon very slightly. Not recommended.\n",
      "Quality sucks. Very tinny sounding, dont stay in place. They are not the apple brand. Very cheaply made. Broke the 4th day. Waste of money.\n",
      "fake not good quality\n",
      "Love!!\n",
      "niece loved em\n",
      "I personally like having the headphones for my phone with a wire. These official branded headphones always seem to hold up better.\n",
      "I have a bad habit of loosing my ear pods. This product is great because of the good quality of sound and the cheap price.\n",
      "Exactly what i hoped for and what a great price. I would definitely by more.\n",
      "sound quality not good\n",
      "Love it\n",
      "I don't remember I order a brand new one or not, but this is obviously used by someone else first, which is kind of frustrating. Because I found a hair in the box, and there is some dirty stuff on the headphones. Kind of Gross\n",
      "They work okay, but there's a short in the cord that sometimes causes the remote not to work and calls cannot be picked up.\n",
      "amazing, as usual!\n",
      "Works good.\n",
      "Fake Stay away from buying these.\n",
      "Apple's earbuds sound great, won't disappoint.\n",
      "Fit, finish, comfortable and sound. Says it all....A++\n",
      "Honestly very disappointed with this purchase. I like Apple headphones and they usually last for a long time. But not even 30 mins into use with this pair the right ear isn't working. I do not recommend getting the (like new) option. But I'm sure the (new) option would do just fine.\n",
      "NOT Apple.  I'm sorry I didn't read the reviews before I purchased.  They were clean but did not have good sound and crackled the first time I used them.  The box they came in was very scratched.  I believe they are refurbished or just plain rubbish.\n",
      "I love these! My first pair lasted me over a year and a half. The sound is excellent and they are very comfortable to wear.\n",
      "the right earphone stopped working the next day i got them they aren't good\n",
      "Earbuds came fast and they work great. Would definitely recommend.  They are the same as regular apple earbuds just half the price!\n",
      "I ordered these thinking that they would be like the normal Apple EarPods that I own. However, upon receiving this item I noticed a human hair INSIDE of the sealed plastic packaging. I then plugged them into my phone and they made a static sound before I even started playing music. I then started playing the music and the quality was unlike that of new headphones. I can say that these are definitely not new.\n",
      "Brand new Earpods i bought it from A & Z tech Inc, 100% genuine\n",
      "Awesome!\n",
      "Not real Apple headphones- really shameful that they are labeled as such. Fakers\n",
      "Perfect love the authentic apple earpods. Air pods are a dumb idea !\n",
      "FAKE,FAKE,FAKE, I believe theses are counterfeit. I bought these as an extra set to go along my genuine Apple EarPods; after comparing the two, it was discovered that the EarPods ordered from Amazon were more of an off white compared to the real deal, also, the sound quality, although not terribly bad, were like night & day; so ya.... do NOT buy this item and expect to get Apple quality!! They are getting sent back!!  Please read all the reviews that people have posted on this product, it seems that I'm not the only one with this theory.\n",
      "Terrible headphones, they said Apple, but all they do is look like them. They have horrible sound and build quality. Do not buy.\n",
      "Sound great like real Apple headphones but the wire is super thin on it and didn't last as long as my real pair of Apple ones before i had these.\n",
      "They are bad quality, However they do the job.\n",
      "Just as described!\n",
      "Wow... amazing sound quality. Nice features. You can feel the beats and bass sound pretty well. This is just what you can expect from Apple! Incredibly Amazing... and \"Class apart\".....\n",
      "Earpods work, but the mic was defective as sent to me—the button to activate voice control and pause music does not function reliably, and the mic does not work.\n",
      "Received these less than a week ago and one earbud has already stopped working. Will not purchase refurb again.\n",
      "The Apple earbuds w/ mic arrived a day before the promised ship date. They work great!\n",
      "Cheap junk.\n",
      "I had the same earpods that came with my IPHONE but they stopped working. Why, I don't know, so I ordered these from Amazon. They are the same as the ones from Apple. They were delivered on time and were packed very well. I'm very satisfied with these EarPods.\n",
      "The ones I got were legit so really it depends on who you buy them from.\n",
      "Good voice quality,  No issues. Work great.\n",
      "Ok at first i only left a good review because i wanted the second pair of headphones but lets face facts, these headphones are crap. I used them two days and they broke while i was using them, the sound is horrible, they do not fit in ear, and the person who you are talking to on the phone while using these will hear a crackling noise that is constant. Do not waste your time with these you will hate yourself\n",
      "Best earbuds in the market\n",
      "My daughter was pleased with the ear buds. The price was very reasonable.\n",
      "The EarPods were improperly wrapped in the casing and the sound quality was not was I would expect from something advertised as a certified Apple refurbished. For you cheap pair of headphones they're decent, however it would be worth it to spend the extra cash to get some good quality headphones that will last.\n",
      "Less than a week of regular use, its falling part, sound now only comes from one ear bud.\n",
      "I Love these headphones.there loud and the bass is so clear\n",
      "These headphones were used.  I returned them immediately.\n",
      "The sound quality is very weak if listening to music is an option.\n",
      "broke the second day I had them\n",
      "Great sound quality. Fit perfectly in your ear and stay there through running or any other workout. Not bulky and easy to store.\n",
      "Good quality but broke in one ear after a few months\n",
      "They're the same headphones you'd get with a brand new iPhone. Case and everything. Only the ones at the apple store are $25+\n",
      "A day after purchasing these headphones they stopped working, wouldn't recommend..\n",
      "Happy with product\n",
      "For me, better than ear buds.\n",

      "great product for great price!  very clear reception!\n",
      "Very Pleased! I will reorder!!!\n",
      "these stopped working within the week I bought them. Im pretty sure they are not real apple earphones. I went to the apple store to make sure I got some authentic apple ones, and they're great. these headphones suck and will break or get a short in them quickly.\n",
      "Excellent product, good delivery\n",
      "Not bed\n",
      "They worked, until my cat ate them. RIP.\n",
      "Received these on Tuesday and by Saturday they no longer worked. Can't return because I threw away the little plastic case. Very disappointed. Purchase with caution and keep the packaging just in case!\n",
      "I question the authenticity of this item. I had similar earbuds that came with my phone in 2013 that have outlived these by years...this set lasted all of six months. I would consider rethinking the purchase. The look almost identical but didn't hold up very well with my 12 year old\n",
      "Great\n",
      "i had lost mine, but i found these and they are no different!!! apple earbuds are by far my favorite!\n",
      "Came out the box with only one side working\n",

      "Came promptly & and was reasonably priced . Works like new ;)\n",
      "None of any EarPods works properly with my iPhone 6s+. Can't listen lyrics only beats.\n",
      "Only worked in one year. Fake.\n",
      "They sound like they've been thrown under 300 feet deep in the Atlantic Ocean, and it has been used by Spongebob. In other other words, they sound terrible.\n",
      "very good\n",
      "Was legit. All these people saying there fake chose the cheapest option of sellers.\n",
      "The earbuds are good but, after about a week or 2 the left ear went out on them. Sucks but they were still good while they lasted.\n",
      "Very good earphones and are from apple\n",
      "I don't think these are real but they are brand new and do the job well.\n",
      "Great Apple earpods!\n",
      "Had these for two months, kept them in the case they came in and only used them a couple days a week, they never left my room. Now randomly they decided to just stop working. One second they're playing music and the next nothing. Awful\n",
      "same quality of original\n",
      "These are terrible. I'm thinking they're knock offs. I bought them once and I kept hearing static. I decided, \"ok maybe I got a bad pair.\" so I decided to return it. When I got my replacement pair, no sound came out of one ear bud!!!  I wasted time and had trouble with calls. Thankfully Amazon has an awesome return policy and I didn't waste my money. But this was frustrating. I ended up buying a different pair from another highly rated brand.\n",
      "These are not ear pods - they are ear buds.  My daughter chose to keep them but they are not compatible with Iphone 7 unless you have the adapter.\n",
      "These are not genuine. The cord is a hard plastic cord, not soft like a genuine apple product. The quality of the sound is poor. OK, but nowhere near the genuine set. Disappointing.\n",
      "Waste of money. Broke after 3rd day of using. Amazon returned my money, thankfully.\n",
      "They came broke from whomever wrapped the phones in it's case. Had to return. Got new ones and they lasted a whole two week.  Not worth it and very, very cheaply made.\n",
      "Thanks they were exactly like the picture and as said in description!\n",
      "Daughter opened and attempted to use\n",
      "Best headphones ever, too bad I lost 'em!\n",
      "Not really good quality to begin with, and one earpiece is already broken after 3 months of use\n",

      "As expected\n",
      "{The picture is taken months after original purchase} There are a lot of bad reviews for these but I purchased them from a four-and-a-half star seller and my pair is perfect. No scratches, no earwax, no pieces falling apart after a week (I've had them for a few months now). My cat chewed my last pair and I think, for $14, these make a perfect replacement. Did I mention they came at least a month early?\n",

      "Grand daughter loves the ear pods.  Good fit, well made.\n",
      "I think these were refurbished because they lasted only a few days before the wire at plug in started failing.  My brand new ear buds that came with my phone were awesome and took my level of wear & tear.  These...didn't last a week.\n",
      "As advertised, genuine Apple replacement EarPods.\n",
      "I'm seriously doubt these are authentic apple headphones. I have dropped my phone from my pocket while listening to music and it bent my headphone jack this badly. I know I've done the same things with the apple headphones I received when I purchased my phones, and the jack only ever had the slightest bend to it and I had those for more than a year and dropped my phone on a regular basis. I would not recommend purchasing from this supplier.\n",

What I find ironic is I've purchased these exact same model twice in the past and no issues... beside her loosing them.  It's a little disappointing that this has happened.  They are definitely being returned tomorrow!  I'm going to try and order another pair and hope that these were just defective.  If not will not purchase again.\n",

      "The Apple ear pods with remote and microphone is my absolute favorite ear pod set.  It is light weight so I hardly know I'm wearing it.  The ear bud part is just the right size so it doesn't hurt my ears.  The person I'm talking to can't tell that I'm using this so you know the microphone is picking up my voice and not a lot of back ground noise.  I bought my brother a set and he loves them too.  I own 3 or 4 pairs and have them in the car and at home.  In California, we have to use hands free while driving and this headset meets that requirement.\n",

      "All I know is I'm stocking up on more of these\n",
      "These are fake! Do not buy them! Even though I read all the postings that said these are fake, I thought that those may have been a few instances out of several purchases. Turns out they are fake. Audio quality is terrible and the \"R\" and \"L\" letters were faded!\n",

      "Perfect.\n",
      "Very bad, earphones were clearly used and don't work. Do not buy\n",
      "These aren't real Apple headphones, DONT BUY THESE. The sound is terrible, the earbuds don't sit in the actual ear, and it feels like they have absolutely no bass or mass whatsoever.\n",
      "Headphones worked but mic, volume control, and playback buttons did not. Furthermore static was produced when the jack was twisted.\n",
      "I actually like the feel and the performance of these buds.  Most people hate them, but these are one of the few I can wear all day and not have my ears hurt.  They do not last, though, so you end up having to buy replacements every year if you are not replacing your phone.\n",
      "I was weary of buying apple headphones off of the internet, but these are ust as pictured and described. Reliable quality and it shipped a few hours after I ordered it! I was so impressed that I bought a second paid\n",
      "I did not see that the headphone were \"like-new\" before I purchased them. I'll admit that was on me. However, the earpods were covered in earwax. Gross. I didn't spend $15 to clean someone else's wax out of my headphones before I could use them happily.  Upon plugging them in, I realized they were quite persnickedy and would only work correctly if they were slightly unplugged. I'm not positive that these are real Apple earpods either. Don't waste your money on these. Buy a new pair from Apple themselves.\n",
      "They are comfortable and good sounding. Would buy again.\n",
      "Basic headphones ; apple but seem cheap.\n",
      "These aren't real apple ear pods. The quality of sound is awful compared to the real product.\n",
      "They did there job for a month but within a week of having them I could no longer control the volume. Then I could no longer hear the music. Considering the ratings I saw on the product before I bought it, I expected more out of my purchase.\n",
      "i bought 3... all three broke... they are not authentic pods... if you don't mind using one ear to listen to all your songs then i do not recommend this product. buy some authentic ones.\n",
      "Broke within days of buying. Do not order these\n",
      "I like how they stay in my ears better.  Sound was so,so.\n",
      "Good\n",
      "Durable Apple EarPods that will last. Just like regular Apple EarPods minus the case which is a con but they have the same durability, comfort, and sound and a very good replacement for the price.\n",
      "the volume buttom never worked no one can hear me when i use the head phone during phone calls only good for listening to music\n",
      "The product looks very nice but sadly the microphone somehow doesn't quite work. The first time I used it was for an important conference call (which was my bad; I should have tested the microphone first) and it made me really look bad because nobody could hear me. Not sure if I received a broken one or something. Wish I could get an exchange.\n",
      "High quality earbuds to replace my broken ones.\n",
      "The controls don't always work, but otherwise fine.\n",
      "Poor quality\n",
      "Received the headphones and they don't even work.  Only one earpiece works and the buttons do nothing.  Very frustrated.\n",
      "Was awesome while it worked,  unfortunately this wasn't ery long.\n",
      "Sound isn't that bad but came in a case that was cracked and the left earbud barely works. I'm disappointed but I'll still use them\n",
      "Mine came covered in dry earwax. Absolutely disgusting.\n",
      "Just to make it easy, these headphones won't fit into your iPhone.\n",
      "These are the worst most uncomfortable earbuds I have ever used! They came with my iPhone 6. After 30-60 minutes of use, expects your ears to hurt the rest of the day. I highly recommend buying panosonic or similar alternative if you're looking for earbuds that won't fall out every few minutes, sound better, are way more comfortable, fit any ear size with adjustable soft ear buds (included), and cost under $10.\n",
      "very nice and useful\n",
      "It is definitely not an authentic apple product. There's this odd echo whenever it used during a call.\n",
      "ok earbuds\n",
      "Product was as described, only complaint is that these don't last very long (Apple EarPods in general).\n",
      "I loved the price of the headphones. but you can tell they weren't real apple headphones the bass and treble was very different and loud. but I did like them.\n",
      "Just one more counterfeit item sold on Amazon. These most certainly are not made by Apple, mine lasted about three weeks and then died. A simple Internet search about fraudulent sales on Amazon will show that there is probably very little sold on this site that isn't counterfeit junk from china.\n",
      "Some comments said they were \"real\" iPod ear buds but they came in iPod case and sound great. I have bought knock off ear buds before and these are sooo much better. I'm happy...price was great and shipping fast.\n",
      "I gave this to my DIL who is a biach! She loves it because she can talk to he BF without my sons knowledge.\n",
      "Great Item\n",
      "This product has good sound quality for those who love bass, as I am one of those people. I, particularly, am an apple enthusiast and I adore these earphones, but it's particularly tiring to keep spending money to have to buy these. If you're very careful with headphones, I think these are perfect for you and will keep you satisfied, but those not as lucky, or those who never go anywhere without their headphones on, expect to keep replacing them.\n",
      "pure apple trash\n",
      "broke within 3 weeks\n",
      "Came Defective\n",
      "Awesome!  Love these.. Fit in the ears good.. Speaker works great too..\n",
      "the clear case had cracks and look like not a new product.\n",
      "Bad, fake, does not work well\n",
      "Simple ear buds.  Nothing major.  Comfortable and clear sound\n",
      "Easy to carry and great and the sound is great.\n",
      "excellent\n",
      "I shouldn't like these as much as I do, but I like the audio quality of these headphones, and they fit me well. I also like the fact they are not sealed headphones (a good choice on Apple's part), so I can still hear outside noises, which is less of a safety hazard.\n",
      "really good headphones\n",
      "Happy with action taken given after I at review  thank you satisfied  time\n",
      "Not real Apple headphones. Great if you need cheap headphones. But if you're looking for real Apple ones, go somewhere else.\n",
      "I thought these headphones were okay until they broke! Headphones should last longer than just a few weeks, especially when they cost more than a few dollars!!!!\n",
      "Always you need good earpods when it comes to music, making calls and nothing matches original Apple Earpods at this price. Even if you buy sennheiser  worth 40 bucks, this piece matches the quality and even is easy to use. There might not be a lot of functions on the remote but at this price it provides you good music and voice quality.\n",
      "EarPods gave me nothing but trouble, horrible sound issues. I ended up going to buy them directly from Apple.\n",
      "Bought these to replace my 3rd pair of broken ones. AAAAAAND they broke.\n",
      "volume buttons quit working very early on.\n",
      "The headphone balance is way off. The right earbud is significantly louder than the left and is just unusable. Really disappointed in the product and shipping took a while as well.\n",
      "Horrible quality\n",
      "Awesome sauce\n",
      "I received my ear buds on time how ever when I tried to use them they didn't work also I found ear wax on both of the ear pieces disgusting!!!!\n",
      "Mines were legit. I wouldn't buy from 3rd parties\n",
      "Thanks\n",
      "Buyer beware as this is one of those items where Amazon is not policing the seller/provider of the merchandise.  Mine were fake and there's simply no way to know if the next pair will be real or fake too. It's obviously very easy to copy the look of these headphones and their authenticity cannot be verified.  For a few more dollars I'll order from Apple's site to ensure they're truly Apple headphones.\n",
      "They came damage without the jack to connect to Ipod/Iphone!!\n",
      "Could be real or fake,the right ear stopped working after say, a hour of very light use.\n",
      "10/10\n",
      "As advertised.\n",
      "FAKE I don't even know how amazon still allows this to happen  they say they're Apple Earphones yet they couldn't be more fake. Truly truly angry just wasted my money\n",
      "Rubbish.  Ripped at the connection in 8 days.\n",
      "Took out of package and wish I could throw away...... total distorted sound ...... very unhappy\n",
      "Broke my old pair..exactly like them\n",
      "Not Apple earbuds.  False advertising\n",
      "Item has incredible quality thank you.\n",
      "I love Apple EarPods they've always fit in my ear better than regular earbuds and the built in mic and great for facetime and phone calls or even recording your voice.\n",
      "One ear bud does not work in both pairs that I bought.\n",
      "The microphone does not work!\n",
      "Very poor quality, they broke within a month of use, very a-typical for the brand. Moderately frustrating.\n",
      "Awesome buy. I love them!!!\n",
      "The worst ear buds. They never worked properly and they were definitely not apple ear buds!\n",
      "This is a total knock-off. I compared it to another set that came with a phone. The wires are flimsy, the microphone is choppy. Disappointed.\n",
      "Great quality mic didn't work at all.\n",
      "The item appears to be Apple EarPods but are not upon closer inspection.  As well, the product I received has a broken mic and the buttons on it do not function.  Do not purchase it is a waste of time.\n",
      "They broke after a week or two. I wind my headphones up around themselves, not tight, but definitely enough that I believe this broke them. I never had this problem with other apple earpods, these didn't seem very high quality.\n",
      "Exclent and original!\n",
      "I love my earphone! After losing my last one, I have been using this. It's very well built. Definitely worth giving 5 stars!\n",
      "Don't seem genuine.\n",
      "Love the product quality.\n",
      "These after only a month shocked my ears!\n",
      "The case was real. Headphones definitely fake. One ear stopped working 2 days later.\n",
      "I would give this 0 stars if I could. These headphones are fake. Amazon should take them off of their site. For one, the sound quality of these headphones are so poor. The bass? Gone. Treble? Gone. Useless piece of crap headphones. These are not apple. Fakes\n",
      "Very solid product. Exactly the same as what Apple ships with their devices and at a great price!\n",
      "Just perfect for me.\n",
      "These are wonderful earpods made by Apple and perfect for my Iphone 6 or other Iphones. Other ear phones seem to work well but then fall apart. These are just like the original earphones we received with our first iphone which lasted a long time. It is nice to be able to control calls from the earphones, too.\n",
      "Not apple\n",
      "It's not good at all, while I'm taking on phone it Ends the call without touching it  and it made made may people feel like I'm hanging the line of them , it get me in trouble , sometimes it runs the music , open a lot of apps , the phone it just goes crazy with no reason.\n",
      "They werent original\n",
      "The left earbud does not work\n",
      "Super cheap to buy but high quality. 10/10.\n",
      "Mic Doesn't work. Waste of my money\n",
      "Great deep sound and better bass. I thoroughly enjoy these.\n",
      "Well, this is the standard iPhone/iPod earbuds you get with your phone, there is nothing else to it.\n",
      "Case was official Apple earbuds case, earbuds were a knock off. Sound quality is poor.\n",
      "These didn't seem real upon receipt and they are already not functioning. Input jack has to be squeezed and rolled to hear anything in right headphone. Sometimes doesn't even work. Poor quality, don't buy!\n",
      "Good\n",
      "Broke immediately. Definitely not authentic Apple ear buds.\n",
      "BAD QUALITY, NOT REAL APPLE. WASTE OF YOUR MONEY. SHOULDN'T BE SOLD ON AMAZON\n",
      "Product does not appear to be real apple product.  It's s fake.\n",
      "I've been using earpods since they came out. Every so often they wear out and I have to replace them. I can make a pair last a year if I'm lucky, but I buy them in twos or threes just incase. Normally they're all perfect.\n",
      "Bought the headphones in early August, both pairs already broken by October. Cheap earphones not meant to last. I kept them in good condition, and was careful with them as I wished that I wasn't going to have to purchase new earphones for at least 6 months. Very disappointed.\n",
      "The sound quality is atrocious- the kind you expect from a por of $3 earbuds from the discount store.\n",
      "Excelent\n",
      "I purchased these fully aware and accepting of the fact that they are not actually Apple brand earpods. I received them on Monday, it is now Thursday and one earpod has already stopped working. I usually purchase knockoff earpods and they last anywhere from three to six months, which is on par with how long the Apple earpods last for me, so I'm not happy with these only working for a couple of days. Amazon customer service was amazing as always. They currently have a replacement pair on their way to me, but I will go back to my usual seller of knockoff earpods.\n",
      "Nice earphones\n",
      "These are not made by Apple.  The quality is quite poor.  The microphone does not work well, I cannot use it for talking on the phone.  The volume control works only intermittently and I have only had them for less than a week.  Do not buy these\n",
      "The first time I ordered these, the headphones were good, I enjoyed them. This new pair I got, the sound quality did not match the first pair I got. And now the right headphone started sending a little shock into my ear, and I tested it on my hand and this product is sending a shock every so often. I'm really disappointed\n",
      "Great! Love them!\n",
      "I bought two sets, first set did not work on the left side, second set the volume control did not work. These come in an Apple box, but are no way an Apple product. They didn't feel right out of the box, thought maybe because they were new, nope. These did not even work for a day.\n",
      "Excellent sound quality and doesn't wear too rough on my ears over long periods of time.\n",
      "grandson loves these!\n",
      "Doesent last long\n",
      "I was looking for a good priced earphones since the Apple ones are super expensive and these worked amazingggg!\n",
      "good\n",
      "They work perfectly and are totally worth it! Considering they're $12 less than in stores (not counting shipping but). Also they came out of the box so I didn't have to spend 5 minutes figuring how to open them which I was thankful for!\n",
      "Theses are not real apple headphones.  they are knock offs\n",
      "clear sound and perfect mic, everyone can hear my voice clearly\n",
      "FAKE\n",
      "The product is not original and quality of the product is not good. It's not worth the price what they are selling.\n",
      "Not the real thing. I've opened multiple pairs of apple earbuds and the differences are obvious. Most notably quality of plastic used and static feedback when in use\n",
      "I love Apple EarPods.\n",
      "Fake!!!  I want my money back!!!\n",
      "Broke in 10 mins cheap material different then real headphones\n",
      "These are fake apple ! Don't buy them !\n",
      "don't worry i promise its the real ones.\n",
      "I bought these about 5 months ago because I lost my original apple ear pods.  I happened to find my original earpods recently and listened to them and they sound a lot better than this pair I bought on Amazon.  These sound a lot thinner and lacks bass compared to my originals. I suspect that they are fake hence the cheap price.  Apple is starting to go after fakes like this on Amazon.  I wouldn't want to be the manufacturer/seller of these fakes.\n",
      "Works, but the bass is terrible and it sounds like it's broken.\n",
      "SUCH A DEAL\n",
      "Not original\n",
      "Can't live without these.  Way cheaper on Amazon than at the Apple Store.\n",
      "These are my favorite headphones of all time hands down. They fit in my ear very well they sound crisp and are just all around very good earpods. I have had no difficulty with them after 3+ months of owning them.\n",
      "Work fine.\n",
      "As described.  Showed up on time.\n",
      "Ones I bought were not made by Apple. Had a very bad connection causing the sound to come out of one side only.\n",
      "They apple lol\n",
      "Good buy\n",
      "I bought these for my son for his birthday because he lost his original pair. He was VERY happy!! Great product!!\n",
      "They weren't good. I threw them to the trash a few days later because the left headphone stopped working.\n",
      "Gotta love Apple earbuds. I use them all the time.\n",
      "These are fake, not real apple. They arrived broken, with the sound only working in one ear. To top that, the sound on the side that WAS working was distorted and weird. Don't waste your money\n",
      "Not real\n",
      "Great\n",
      "These are genuine earpods. I bought multiple pairs from different sellers and these were the only ones that had the apple logo on the wire and worked the way original ones do. Definitely going to buy these again when mine stop working rather than paying like $35 from the apple store like I used to.\n",
      "not authentic! returned it..\n",
      "Nice\n",
      "Works perfect great sound.\n",
      "great\n",
      "it works as advertised\n",
      "Works better than expected\n",
      "First off, let me say that these are definitely apple headphones. The packaging is the exact same. the look is the same, the quality is the same. that being said,\n",
      "Not an Apple product. Bad audio quality, broke very quickly.\n",
      "I ordered two pair and have been told by co-workers that they create a squeaky digital noise while I was using them on conference calls.  The controls on the mic don't work as well.  Can't hang up by pushing the middle, etc.  They are fine to listen to music with but since I am on the phone in meetings 50% of my workday (which is what I bought them for), they receive a low rating from me.\n",
      "They literally lasted a month. Disappointment avenue.\n",
      "These headphone are terrible. The sound quality is good for a week or two, then it declines. I had these for a month and they completely fell apart. I would not recommend ever getting these.\n",
      "Not the same as Apple headphones.  I'm a wrestler and one of my ears are swollen which help me tell the different in the fit.  I have had people also complain about hearing me from the microphone.  Overall I would spend the extra $10 on real apple headphones.\n",
      "These early pods are fake.... don't be fooled by the genuine lies.\n",
      "Great Product!  Fast Shipping!!\n",
      "Zero stars.\n",
      "for the price, these are great headphones... no idea if they are really apple headphones but I can't tell if a difference if they aren't, haha\n",
      "These are fake, very low quality. I wouldn't mind that they're fake if the sound was good, but the sound is horrible and tinny.\n",
      "thank you\n",
      "Excellent\n",
      "These were not authentic Apple earpods.  Compared to a set that came in an unopened original packaging (with apple emblem), they were shorter and the quality of the material was noticeably lower.  Also the call answer function did not work. The caller on the other end was not able to hear me on the phone call.\n",
      "Amazing nice sound and have not worn out in any way.\n",
      "After only a month of use, they started giving horrible feedback on the other side of the line. People couldn't hear me or the static would ruin conference call situations. Definitely would NOT recommend. Not worth the savings to only have them work a month or two.\n",
      "The headphones I recieved were not apple brand.\n",
      "Its quality is okay, not as good as what I expect, I don't think it's a good earphones with such price.\n",
      "It is great!\n",
      "these didn't work.  terrible.  company has stopped selling them I believe.\n",
      "These are great! Been using for a year and only a week ago have I small amount of coiling in the wires. Will buy again when needed!\n",
      "The ear buds worked at aspected, the sound quality was average, durability was not up to par, but they were very comfortable.\n",
      "Worked at first but then became very static for no reason whatsoever. Do not buy! I've purchased these headphones before, and they wer fine. Obviously something changed with the product. Not worth the money.\n",
      "Works decent for the price. Can easily tell they're fake. My biggest problem is that an edge stuck out and bothered my ear.\n",
      "Very good quality- Instead of spending $5 here and there for junk- get these - they are the BEST!\n",
      "they were great recently had an accident that damaged them\n",
      "works great\n",
      "Bought 3 of these for my dad to use when talking on the phone with his workers while driving and all of them worked and my dad said they had fantastic quality! I would recommend these headphones to anyone.\n",
      "They were fake. Returned and went to the Apple Store instead.\n",
      "is  bad bad bad ear pods\n",
      "I was actually expecting less from what i see they are legit they come with a serial number and \"designed in california\" and all that stuff printed along the wire . And they work pretty good .\n",
      "This product is pretty good, I have been an apple fan for a few years now and I haven't always liked their eadpods because they didn't fit my ears, but this new design is great. They fit my ears and I can listen to all of the nickelodeon theme songs I can on Spotify. The sound is nice and crisp and the microphone that comes with it is great. And the price is just too good not to purchase.\n",
      "These are not real apple ear pods.\n",
      "They're comfortable and the built-in controls are convenient. Sound quality isn't great, and I'm not big on in-ear headphones to begin with, but when I'm in a pinch and need a pair, these ones do the trick just fine.\n",
      "After waiting almost a month, I finally received my ear buds.  They are a excellent product for the price, just wish they would have arrived earlier.\n",
      "I tried to save money by buying this through amazon, I lost my last pair and admittedly love them more than most earbuds.  Second I opened them and plugged them in, I got static and one earbud keeps going in and out.  I was very disappointed in this purchase.\n",
      "good\n",
      "Love It\n",
      "works perfect! i have owned these for months and have not had any issues\n",
      "works good so far.\n",
      "I purchased these ear pods in June of 2013 and have been using them on a daily basis.  I listen to audio books all day long about 8 to 10 hours a day.  I am just now checking out a new pair on 9/18/2016. I looked over the earpods I got with my 5c iphone very carefully and could find no difference.  I think I got my money out of the product, no complains!  A little update to this review, all the 2016 reviews are very low so I looked at my order from 2013 and noticed that the seller was Amazon Inc and the price was very close to the Apple Store price.  Now the price is $10 cheaper and there is a different seller. I'm staying with 5 stars for my 2013 purchase but will not buy these again.\n",
      "Worked fine at first, but after a month the headphone jack completely broke off and got stuck in my phone. Pretty disappointing!\n",
      "It is just like the one that came with the phone! It works well. I gave up on the blue tooths, people always complained.  I get no complaints with these.\n",
      "Always the BEST\n",
      "Not true apple buds\n",
      "It says by \"Apple\" but these are fake headphones with overall cheaper quality. Get the real deal somewhere else.\n",
      "One worked, one did not...\n",
      "Not bad at all. The price is great and the sound is great\n",
      "Very good product crisp clear noise lasted me for over a year definitely would buy again\n",
      "Okayish quality and it doesnt work well in loud areas\n",
      "Don't buy. Fake and cheap quality... Broken after 1 month regular use.\n",
      "Work great\n",
      "Not genuine apple merchandise. Broke in less than a month. Do not buy these headphones.\n",
      "Still in working condition months and months later! Thank you!\n",
      "Didn't realize these were coming from the UK so they took awhile to get to us. I know people get these for free when you purchase Apple items. So to sell them is kind of crazy, but my son likes them and his other ones were broken. The items was fine when we got it.\n",
      "These are not real Apple earpods. Mine broke within a month.\n",
      "Not the same quality of sound as my old pair were. Almost feel like they are knock offs or something.\n",
      "These ear buds have worked really well for me.  They have the accessory that allows you to control the volume and talk on the phone on the earphone wire\n",
      "Excellent!\n",
      "Earphones shocked my ears\n",
      "Great\n",
      "They hurt my ears, and only last a few months before breaking\n",
      "Bought these for my son. Good buy\n",
      "SO FUNNY. He shipped an empty bag to me LMAO nothing in it but a receipt...\n",
      "They broke in less than a week \n",
      "Typically apple ear buds. After a while they do make my ears hurt.\n",
      "Comfortable. Mic is adequate for Skype chats. Sound is adequate too. All in all it's a nice mediocre paid or ear buds.\n",
      "worth the money\n",
      "Good fit  and good clarity listening.  Best price.\n",
      "Enhances the sound of my favorite songs.. It also lasts longer than any other apple earhpones. Great!\n",
      "Judging by the other reviews, you have to be careful which seller you pick. We bought this product twice from Amazon directly (not only fulfilled by Amazon) and had no issues; the product we received is definitely genuine and well priced ($12).\n",
      "Excellent!!\n",
      "These are amazing. They work perfectly and I love them. They are extremely affordable, which I love! They are good quality and last a long time. I'll definitely buy another pair when the time calls for it.\n",
      "Amazing quality!\n",
      "They broke within 3 days.\n",
      "Quality of sound is not as expected\n",
      "Excellent. 100% original.\n",
      "I received 2 pairs of earpods, each of which was packaged incredibly poorly in a way that actually damaged the cables prior to even opening the package. These earpods are clearly made of lower quality materials, as the kinks in the cables from wrapping them in the packaging are still there, despite a week of daily use. One the 2nd day after receiving them, the Left earpiece of the first pair stopped working. 3 days later, after I had stopped using the first pair, the 2nd pair had the same exact issue. The packaging also looked used and was somewhat dirty upon delivery. THESE ARE NOT REAL APPLE EARPODS AND I REGRET SPENDING THE MONEY.\n",
      "Terrible!!!!! Not real Apple! Mine broke quickly and the material is crummy! Don't waste your money!\n",
      "Legit\n",
      "Such a rip off. Bought these headphones two weeks ago and they already do not work. I would give 0 stars if I could. Do not buy from this vendor!\n",
      "They hurt my ears. Ouch. And the Sound quality isn't all that great.\n",
      "Fake. They will corrode and ruin your headphone jack\n",
      "I always lose these so these are great replacements.  And super affordable.\n",
      "The same as the ones that come with the phones.\n",
      "They are not fake they are very good\n",
      "The best\n",
      "You can hear fine on these, just don't try to talk on the phone through them.  The other party says that you sound like you are rolling through a metal tube with a bunch of rocks.  ALL 4 were like this.  A waste.\n",
      "seems to be imitated it\n",
      "Fine. These feel not as good as actual apple headphones though.\n",
      "Apple Ear pods always love them.\n",
      "Pretty good, still uses them!\n",
      "Very Good\n",
      "I did not like these they did not work for my iPhone 6\n",
      "Love these ear buds.\n",
      "Bought these from TAYLTH LLC. The left side is broken and the mic doesn't work AT ALL.\n",
      "If you're an audiophile or someone looking for the most pristine, perfect sound, you probably aren't even reading Apple EarPod reviews. They're just what I needed though: they've lasted well, sound good, work great to control my iPhone, and the sound quality is clear on the microphone. Honestly, couldn't ask for more in a pair of headphones for what I need them for.\n",
      "Garbage. They cut in and out. I wouldn't buy again.\n",
      "The mic pause play button and volume buttons on the cord don't work and are just for show.\n",
      "eAR BUDS FAILED after 6 months\n",
      "Works perfectly for me.  The buttons work with my iPhone 6S.  Can't leave home without these.  Can't imagine life without ear buds!\n",
      "These were okay. I just wanted to have back up ear pods, really. The sound quality is okay except when you press too hard on the part that's connected to your phone like when you put it in your back pocket. Other than that, my only complaint was that I used prime for this and it came SO LATE. It said delivered two days after ordering it and it didn't come till two and a half weeks later. I don't even get why that happened.\n",
      "Definitely authentic\n",
      "Good product\n",
      "Bought 2 pairs. With one the right earbud had no sound. With the other pair, the left earbud had no sound! Tested with multiple audio devices. Tested audio devices with previously bought earbuds which worked fine. Buy something of better quality.\n",
      "One of the earbuds stopped working after 30 min of listening\n",
      "Excelente!\n",
      "Better than my genuine Apple earbuds\n",
      "loved it\n",
      "The sound quality is good but the problem with these earbuds is it not good for everyone when it comes to staying in your ear if a go to the gym or a run it fall off immediately:(\n",
      "says its will come 8/16/16 and still not here!!!!!!! its the 18th now don't buy\n",
      "there were 3 reasons why I new they weren't the fake cheap ones. 1) the fake ones were smaller and these actually fit in my ear without shaking around. 2) the fake ones have a line going horizontally where the ear bud says L or R and the one that I bought didn't look like that. you can see for yourself in the review where the earbuds have 2 R buds. they don't have that line that the cheaper and fake models had. 3) the sound felt really similar to the ones that Apple makes.\n",
      "These broke within the first month!!!\n",
      "Great item\n",
      "They made my ears hurt at the start so they should think about making it a bit smaller. But otherwise the sound quality was topnotch and almost gave me a headache by how well the sound traveled.\n",
      "Sounds and feels great, no issues here. Its my 3 rd time buying as well.\n",
      "Fine product\n",
      "The microphone does not work!\n",
      "Still using. Good product.\n",
      "These are great! The quality is apple, period. The shipping was fast and great packaging They got everything right, every port, the mic, and length. Definetly great. The sound is just like apple, i cant see a difference.\n",
      "fell apart.\n",
      "Apples gets too much criticism. They are very good sounding and high quality.\n",
      "They were both broke when I received them\n",
      "Not real apple headphones\n",
      "Volume control started to fail a few weeks after purchase, and stopped working completely after a couple of months. Given the low price and bad quality, I'm assuming the ear pods were a knock off, not an original Apple product.\n",
      "For the price they were fine, but I would have like better quality.\n",
      "Terrible. Broke after one month. Only worked while plugged into usb charger on my laptop. As soon as unplugged - nothing. No sound, no blinking lights. Tried to reach out to company through amazon, but there is no contact info for them and no one responded to my amazon inquiry. Complete waste. Before they broke, they were great though.\n",
      "I thought these were the best for a long time but then I tried some Golzer ones and they're SO MUCH LOUDER. Quit depriving yourselves in the name of fashion folks and invest in a good pair.\n",
      "I got exactly what I paid for.\n",
      "These are NOT authentic Apple Earbuds. The sound quality was terrible, one earbud was 50% the volume of the other at all times, and the remote did not work. Do not buy these.\n",
      "Sound quality is great!!!! Can't beat the price either!\n",
      "The headphones are great! Said like new, but they seem brand new. Some reviews say they got fake apple headphones, but I thinks its because they ordered the new ones from China, I ordered my from the amazon facility.\n",
      "Good for price\n",
      "LOOOVE these! Great Price, Great Product!\n",
      "The headset works ok but the microphone does NO noise cancelling so that part is almost useless.\n",
      "They stopped working within one week of purchase.\n",
      "These earbuds work really well!  I've seen a lot of reviews saying they're fake, don't work or the sound quality is crap.  Maybe it was just a one in a million thing for me, but mine are great!  The sound quality is good, it came in the original apple plastic container and they just work well in general!  Amazing buy!\n",
      "I'm not quite sure if these are authentic... but they're great! They sound just like the ones that come with your phone. Great quality.\n",
      "Crappy headphones, not worth buying just go to the apple store I guess\n",
      "If the earbud jack is touched slightly, there is very loud static and both of the earbuds will randomly cut out sound. It was \"certified refurbished,\" but this product should not have been approved as being functional.\n",
      "didn't last\n",
      "Best earbuds for the price!\n",
      "Terrible they are some knockoffs and my left earbud doesnt even work\n",
      "Work as expected. Loud with plenty of bass.\n",
      "awesome buds\n",
      "Received headphones today, two weeks after original delivery date. This is due to package coming from Asia to USA. There is a short in cord of headphones. The right ear bud has a crackle when listening to heavy base. Very disappointed!\n",
      "They're just like my old ones: when the cord is bent at the point where it goes into the phone, even the slightest, I hear static.\n",
      "The product I received wasn't an authentic Apple product. I did not buy these from Amazon but another company. The EarPods were for my daughter and she does say the sound is a bit different than the authentic. However, for the price I paid and the fact that my daughter lost her Apple ones, I am okay with the knockoffs. I got these in April and she still has them and are still working just fine. I would just suggest if you are looking for authentic, buy directly from Amazon.\n",
      "I looooove these. Honestly the best headphones I bought so far. I'm not sure if it will last a long time but we'll see.\n",
      "two days after purchasing, one ear is messed up!!\n",
      "bought as an extra set, comes in handy.\n",
      "These can't be real apple headphones.  I purchased them in May and they already broke.. no sound comes out at all and i don't even use them often.  I store them neatly and took good care of them.  Do what i did this time around and order them from the Apple store.  Costs more but they come with a warranty and you know your getting the genuine thing.  Even the listings that say they are \"Genuine Apple\" are not.  They are fake.\n",
      "Great!\n",
      "Sounds so good!\n",
      "They work but the sound quality is poor\n",
      "They work just like the originals.\n",
      "Sound is okay but they aren't authentic Apple\n",
      "Very comfy and great sound.\n",
      "Good earphones. Work nice and without problems\n",
      "So much better than my original set! Sound quality is good, but what I really love is the shape of the ear pieces. A whole lot better than the round design, these fit my ears much more comfortably. I use this set mostly to talk on the phone (I only rarely play music on my phone), and everyone can hear me just fine.\n",
      "Sound quality is like that of those bought directly from Apple. However, the volume buttons stick and do not click how they're supposed to. Product feels refurbished or used. I do not recommend buying from this seller.\n",
      "Works good\n",
      "Only thing is they were snatched out of my ears and the ear pieces came apart. They were easily clicked back together, but now I hear less in one ear.\n",
      "Great Apple headphones - work perfectly!\n",
      "Very good product.\n",
      "excellent\n",
      "Been buying these for years and they are always great.\n",
      "I used these headphones one time and the coating that covers the wires started to split. The sound was good tho\n",
      "it works\n",
      "For only 2 weeks, the left one is broken. Even at the beginning when I got it, the sound sometimes was bad and very low.\n",
      "One of the EarPods was broken as soon as I put them on\n",
      "Garbage! They don't even deserve one star. They are imposters and didn't even work! I returned them for authentic Apple ear buds. Buyer beware!\n",
      "Definitely fake, compare it to the real apple product and a great distinction. Don't know why they advertise Apple earbuds but be warned.\n",
      "These earpods don't work after a couple of months\n",
      "Ordered these headphones and received a pink life-proof case instead. I also received a very odd letter about removing my iCloud and factory resetting my iphone before returning the product.\n",
      "I may have gotten a defective pair, but the volume controls don't work, the pause button rarely works and the right earpod went out after only a few weeks.\n",
      "Worked perfectly when refurbished\n",
      "ok\n",
      "Great purchase.\n",
      "The EarPods  arrived on time and now I just love them. They sound really nice and clear. I recommend them to anyone and it makes a good present.\n",
      "Great ear fit and unlike round ear buds these don't fall out plus more durable heavier wires.\n",
      "Work great !!!\n",
      "The headphones were advertised as \"genuine\" Apple EarPods when they are clearly not. The buttons don't work, the volume maxes out at about half what the real things do, and the plastic feels cheaper than the real thing. They are clearly fake! This is my third time attempting to write a review, but Amazon keeps rejecting it. I hope this one is objective enough for their standards.\n",
      "These are great.  Can't tell the difference from the EarPods received with my iPhone.\n",
      "Work amazing!\n",
      "Definitely not an Apple project.  Also, died after two months.  The mic and volume control stopped working.\n",
      "Ordered two of these, just opened the second set and they are broke.  First only one side worked and 5 minutes later they quit working completely when I tried the volume control on the headphones.  Past return date so it is just a loss.  They are junk\n",
      "Work great\n",
      "Great\n",
      "Work very well, especially in using the mic on your phone, but if you use these on your game consoles (not on PC), no one will hear you talking, or at best will hear you \"SUPER\" Quiet\n",
      "they will work for a while  then after a few weeks or months they will stop working and instead of hearing the song you would hear the beat but with static along with it\n",
      "Very poor quality. Won't recommend to anyone.\n",
      "Great!\n",
      "They work great especially for the price.\n",
      "It's been a couple of months and the right ear phone has no sound. Did not read reviews, I thought this was a real Apple product. Amazon should not allow this product to be sold as an Apple product. Misleading to costumers.\n",
      "3 years since I purchased it and still works beautifully even after a rough use! I bought a new iPhone after that, but still haven't switched headphones.\n",
      "Awesome!\n",
      "Good until the cat eats it. I'm about to buy another one. Friggin cat...\n",
      "Not too bad\n",
      "All seems great thanks!\n",
      "it enhances the sound quality of my favorite songs. It's very affordable and compatible to almost all types of devices.\n",
      "Not sure if they're real or knockoffs.  I bought two and friends complain about the sound from both pairs.  I'm not crazy about them.\n",
      "The material feels extremely fake. The wire is very bent and the plastic wire is distorted. Volume button barely works almost popping off. Do not buy this!\n",
      "I don't think these are true Apple earbuds. They come in Apple packaging, but when I plugged into my iPhone 6, they immediately distorted when the plug rotated a tiny bit. The volume and play/stop button worked initially, but after a day's use, it stopped working. I would not recommend these at all. Complete waste of money.\n",
      "very good\n",
      "Love this item, the packaging was elite and genuine. The only earphones I would ever purchase from Amazon\n",
      "Girlfriend loves them, her old ones broke and she wanted another pair of Apple specific ones. She hasnt complained at all so far.\n",
      "Works great\n",
      "These are not real Apple headphone!! They worked well for a little while, but then the pair I was using and the pair my husband was using both fell apart around the same time. Not great quality\n",
      "After receiving a set that was not in very good shape the company sent me a new one in the original packaging.  I knew from the start that this items is very fragile as the wiring is very flimsy so I handled it with great care, even so after using it twice I have an issue already of the jack connection causing cutting in and out on the mic and earphones.  Apple needs to do a better job of making something that is not so fragile and wonky.\n",
      "\n",
      "I really liked it, very affordable price, unlike the $30 they usually are at!\n",
      "For some reason my Earpods have a cracking noise.\n",
      "These earbuds have poor sound quality.  Both music and voices during phone calls sound distant and a slightly muffled. Would not recommend.\n",
      "These are the worst product you can get.. Recived used earbuds with ear wax build on the ear piece.. They say NEW, not......So discussing and gross..\n",
      "Sound quality was good but the steel wire that holds the ear buds in place just broke off while I was working out.\n",
      "Supposedly they're not authentic but they work just like the real ones.\n",
      "very nice\n",
      "My EarPods stopped working after a year and I need a new pair. I ordered these and I can honestly say these are not genuine. The first ones I received, I noticed that the EarPods are not the same length, one EarPods has a longer cable than the other. While I didn't have a problem with them being used or anything, the packing definitely looked real but it wasn't. When I had AppleCare, I exchanged my headphones once and I kept the cases, I exchanged them at the Apple store so they were definitely genuine. I kept them in case I needed them, and took them out to compare them. Both of the cases were exactly the same, and when I compared it to the one I bought on amazon, there was one tiny difference. The originals were marked with \"China\" while the amazon one wasn't.\n",
      "Just like the one from my original purchase\n",
      "When I get it,the label is tore off.\n",
      "I was very happy to have found apple ear pods for such a reasonable price.  However, while I can hear perfectly well with the ear pods no one could hear me. That is right I could not use the ear pods to make a phone calls because the person on the other could hear nothing.\n",
      "Just like the originals apple brand.  If this is a knockoff, is a really good one\n",
      "Just as described!\n",
      "I have used these almost every day. They are good, however the buttons don't work on my work laptop which is a PC. I also have a pair of Bose headphones, but because these are in ear, instead of over ear, I use these ones more often. They perform comparatively well. Although they are not noise cancelling, they do provide some noise dampening due to their construction. I would highly recommend these especially if you own any Apple products.\n",
      "I've had these only a month and they've already broken. The right ear pod no longer works. They must be a Chinese rip off.\n",
      "These are OK they work but are not quality, but don't expect them to last, I bought 2 pairs and one is already broken. I would advise to spend a bit more money and get ones that will last.\n",
      "NOT APPLE PRODUCT! DO NOT BUY.  This is false advertising.\n",
      "Perfect!  Just like the ones when I got my phone.  We don't have cable but stream a lot of video on our phones. We have kids so it's nice to plug these into our ears so not to wake them.\n",
      "It functions as required.  It fits and feels like the original headphones.  The problem that really bothers me is that the microphone seems to rattle.  You can tell that it isn't the best of quality, but it still works.\n",
      "Good product at good price\n",
      "Really bad\n",
      "Great price and work just as expected\n",
      "Typical earpods, ordered 2 and one of them was a fake\n",
      "FAKE! These are not from Apple and don't sound like the genuine earpods from Apple. Knock-offs.\n",
      "So in love with these earbuds, they aren't terrible but I honestly like them way more than any earbud I have ever owned.  I use them all the time and they last me quite awhile.\n",
      "Very good sound quality AUTHENTIC Apple Earpods directly shipped and sold by Amazon LLC.\n",
      "Awesome sound quality.\n",
      "It's infuriating how this manufacturer is falsely advertising that these headphones are made by Apple. Yes, it does say in the Q&A that they are not apple original, but in the title and in the \"By\" field it says Apple. I wouldn't be as upset if at least they worked well, but I've only used them for a week, and the connection is already failing. The right earbud doesn't even work anymore, and the Remote/Mic part stopped working as well. DO NOT BUY.\n",
      "After listening to music for an hour or so they became muffled. Not like the ones you get with your IPhone\n",
      "Came faster than expected and work great\n",
      "Perfection. Quality. Price. The three main reasons why I bought this earpods with no second thoughts. amazing!\n",
      "Price is good.\n",
      "Just like the orignals\n",
      "As expected. If you're expecting Apple headphones, that's what you're getting!\n",
      "These are not the authentic apple earpods, that being said--they are just as good. My old earpods had broken and I was pretty bummed since I didn't want to pay $30 for a new pair. I was hesitant about buying these since I wasn't sure if they were authentic or even good--but I was very pleasantly surprised. They have the strong bass that I was looking for in the earpods. You can tell by the feel of the wire that they are not the apple earpods, but I actually like the feel of these better! They don't feel like a single tug will break the wire! The remote and mic works very well too! I've called multiple people using these and everyone has said that they don't hear a difference! Overall I am very pleased with this product--it has been a while since I bought them and they have lasted daily use so far!\n",
      "I have broken 3 of these so far.  I'm not hard on them, stuff just happens.  For the price, I expect a more sturdy product.  I suggest plantronics wireless headphones if you can get the good quality ones (if less than 15$ you are getting knockoffs)\n",
      "Love them\n",
      "Only one ear works, not good at all\n",
      "So anybody can make anything and call it an Apple product? Weird. Anyways these are junk,  the mic doesn't work.\n",
      "Love these earbuds!\n",
      "Good sound and quality. Happy.\n",
      "Quality sound, much more comfortable than other ear buds\n",
      "Perfect!\n",
      "Great quality\n",
      "Exactly what I asked for\n",
      "It's been less than a month since I purchased 2 pairs, one pair didn't work while the other pair is already broken...\n",
      "Very nice product. I like the design a lot. The sound quality is also pretty nice.\n",
      "Bought 2 pair only one ear on both pairs worked wasted my money would not buy, I'm not happy \n",
      "Definitely not from Apple but work fine. Lack of Apple packaging and marring on case show that this is not from Apple. Maybe a knockoff, maybe a defective product from an Apple factory, idk. Kinda deceiving page because if you buy quick, you'll think it's from Apple. I'd suggest just going to the Apple Store to guarantee your product is legit. Or just buy another type of headphones. All said, these work fine, haven't broken, and the mic/volume control works.\n",
      "I dont complain too much about sound quality because these we're a good price. But the left earbud is significantly louder than the right. Also the earbuds arrived crooked so they make some noise when I run with these.\n",
      "Great deal. They work perfect.\n",
      "Exactly as expected!\n",
      "Last pretty long. Worth the money.\n",
      "I like these headphones and my previous pair lasted me for years.\n",
      "Arrived promptly and item is as expected.\n",
      "I'm so glad Apple redesigned their earphones, the old ones would NEVER fit in my ears because they are soo small. These are great! I can workout and stay active and they stay in so well. Most of my pairs last about a year or so, great purchase for everyday running around headphones. I do have over the ears that I wear on the plane though because they are easier to hear movies/video on the plane.\n",
      "Bargain.\n",
      "Biggest pieces of CRAP headphones I have ever had. Fell apart within 3 days of having them!\n",
      "Based on some of the positive reviews I thought I'd try these because of the price. I have a habit of losing my Apple earbuds and thought if these work that would be great. Not only are they 1/3 cost of Apple but you get two! Buyer be aware. They do look like Apple. After using them for phone conversations for a day most people said I was breaking up or they couldn't hear me, or I sounded like I was rustling with paper. When I removed the headphones it was fine. Ok, I got a defective unit I thought, so I tried the second one. The sleeve which covered the wiring above the jack just fell off! I returned then. If it seems too good to be true it usually is. I went and bought a pair of genuine Apple headsets. Sure they cost more, but there's no comparison in quality. These are certainly cheap knock offs. Stay away.\n",
      "Great headphones\n",
      "Broke the second week I had them after just a few uses. The volume control buttons came right off and is just exposed wire now\n",
      "Not very well made. They work for about 1 week then they start to have issues.\n",
      "Horrible and waste of money\n",
      "Doesn't stay in your ear, but it does the Job well enough without any real technical problems. If only it had some method to stay in place better.\n",
      "Apple headphones are the best. Love the sound quality.\n",
      "Were off brand and not Apple like post stated...broke within 2 days;-(\n",
      "Not even three months later, and the right side earbud on each of these does not work. Sound quality was ok, mic and remote work ok. Disappointed in failure of right side earbuds.\n"

      "These were not meant to go in your ear. Pathetic excuse for headphones. The cord was shorted on my first use and my ears were hurting after 5 minutes of use. I love apple products, but these headphones are garbage. Save your money and look elsewhere for quality headphones.\n",
      "As expected.\n",
      "Its been over six months and i'm still using them. Great quality.\n",
      "bought 4 of them to use as gifts but 2 broke within 3 days of use.... i am on the 3rd set but wont give the last away as I fear it too will break right away..... tend to doubt these are OEM apple ear buds as my original set lasted 2 years before having any issue\n",
      "Could only hear out of one ear bu\n",
      "Quality earphones and packaged well, as expected from Apple\n",
      "I'm sure basically everyone else is suffering from knock-offs. I would imagine that happens constantly. This listing is a crime, and I sincerely wish that it was much more controlled.That said, I ordered these and got real earbuds. Data vision was my disruptor. Which has terrible reviews when they had a brick and mortar in NYC (mostly customer service) but appear to have solid ratings as a distributor and authorized apple reseller, also have a solid rating by the BBB. I filed a return claim before I even got these in the mail after reviewing my order and seeing these comments, but had to check it out when they arrived. I can't prove these are counterfeit, after researching extensively, and I 100% think they're real. I have absolutely no reason to  not believe that, having checked absolutely everything. They sound as good as you expect apple earbuds to be, the packaging and printing checks out, they're exactly what I expected and so I felt compelled to write a review in favor of some of the sellers of these. At least that one that sent me a legitimate thing. I took a star down because everyone else is having a bad experience with this platform and getting awful products. I should vote lower but I personally got what I ordered fortunately.\n",
      "These are fakes. The sound quality is complete s***. Don't waste your money on them.\n",
      "Don't waste your money, they tear up and break, not durable!!!!\n",
      "Just like the others that came with all my iPhone's.\n",
      "Trash do not waste your money .\n",
      "Unfortunately I can't give this a lower rating but it was absolute s***.. As soon as I plugged it in, the sound was terrible and heard a lot of static.. Do not buy anything from this seller..\n",
      "These are the cheapest pieces of plastic I have ever bought! 16 bucks for these things?! They make the sound bassy and muffled... The material feels cheap! These headphones suck! They are not worth it! It's like they were made in China!\n",
      "The left earpod does not work\n",
      "This set of earphones came packaged in the same white box with the apple crest on the back that had me believing it was a genuine apple EarPod.  I lost my original set of earpods and cracked these open recently.... and I found their quality to be severely lacking.  No wonder the price is 1/3rd of the original item.  The sound quality is horrible and is a 1/10 in bass reproduction.  You can feel the wires in the original apple equipment are thicker than the wires in this product.  The Microphone also has cut out during calls.  At least the volume control works.  I am really disgusted how this seller and others are producing knock off versions and trying to pass them off as the genuine article.\n",
      "I was tricked into buying these as \"apple\" earpods.  I bought them for gifts and when they arrived it became clear they were knockoffs.  I didn't have time to reorder, so I gave them anyway.  So far, it appears that they are working, but I don't know of the quality.  I don't  think they should  these are apple ear pods.\n",
      "This is the exact headset that comes with the iPhones.  I accidentally ordered from another company and will be ordering from this one next time.  The other ones looked the same, but not the same quality as this one.\n",
      "i bought this ones and they dont sound so low, gotta use broken old ones, i dont think this are the original ones\n",
      "Legit apple earbuds. Also faat shipping.\n",
      "they break easily...  But they'll do...\n",
      "Not the original iPhone ear buds, it's so flimsy it came apart jus putting ithe on my device. I'm so careful with my ear buds but these just come apart 1st day. I'm so disappointed, it's not even worth $1. It's so cheap if u even look at it, it falls apart!!\n",
      "They are already starting to cut out when I'm using them..\n",
      "Came slightly defected. Had to adjust the cord at first, but problem went away on its own eventually. I love apple headphones, they're durable, reliable, and comfortable!\n",
      "These are not Apple earpods.  The inferior sound quality makes this fact immediately known.  Don't be fooled.  It's not worth the time/money to return either.\n",
      "great product. original in original packaging.\n",
      "when I wanted to put the volume at a decent volume the right ear would puzz and the sound quality was just bad. just go to the actual Apple Store and buy them, even though it's more money it's worth it.\n",
      "This is fake\n",
      "Fake, not even decent fakes either. Sound quality is terrible.\n",
      "They state these are OEM but seem like they are made of a different material and they do not sound as good as the original in box ear buds. .\n",
      "Love these ear buds. Great price!\n",
      "Stopped working after a week\n",
      "It worked for only one week. Now I can hear sound only through right one not the left. Not a good buy at all\n",
      "Broke easy\n",
      "Sound quality is bad. Looks like genuine Apple but from reading other reviews I'm assuming they are knock off.\n",
      "I almost never review products, but I have to review these earbuds because they're so unbelievably bad they made me laugh out loud. As other reviewers have mentioned, the sound quality is terrible: thin, tinny, and weirdly scratchy. That alone would make them unusable for me. But when I took them out of the case, I noticed that something inside the earpieces was loose and rattling around. I thought it was strange, but they worked okay, so I shrugged and went for a walk with the earbuds in.Each step made the loose bit in the earbud rattle. It's deafening when the earbud is actually in your ear. The rattling drowned out the tinny music, so...yay? I'd say you get what you pay for, but honestly, even FREE these earbuds wouldn't be worth it. I bought mine \"Used - Like New\" and they were pretty cheap, so I'll toss these and buy some authentic Apple earbuds. Save yourself some trouble and just go to the Apple store.\n",
      "Do not buy\n",
      "Horrible broke fast I think they where fake\n",
      "Apple loves to tout their designs but they miserably failed with these headsets.  While the earbuds fit perfectly in the ears, the volume toggle (running own the right earbud cable) makes me want to take a hammer to these headphones.  Wearing these with a dress shirt, or any shirt that has a collar, is infuriating.  The volume toggle constantly catches on the shirt collar and pulls down on the right ear bud.\n",
      "These are obvious knock offs. They do the job but not worth the price.\n",
      "This was not new.  The earbud wires were crimped and had notches/nicks in the wires.  Missing the authentic seal from Apple.  I returned the product.\n",
      "I just love my apple ear pods. They last a very long time. I've only had to replace them because my one pair was stolen. My cat chewed the cord for one pair, and it still works beautifully, a year later! I will never buy other earbuds!\n",
      "My job allows us to use headphones for work and I got these because my previous set broke. These work great with my IPhone and it’s my everyday essential for work.\n",
      "Total Waste of money.\n",
      "I love the Apple earphones. They are the only ones that don't make my ears ache. The only problem, is that they can wear down easily. I'm so happy I can buy them on here for a great price. Very happy customer\n",
      "Just as expected!\n",
      "Broke about a week after I bought them. Terrible product.\n",
      "mic wasn't very good.  cheaply made.\n",
      "I was dumb and didn't read the reviews before buying. Very cheap. I could've gottwn the same quality at CVS. I want my money back.\n",
      "The only headphones that fit my sons small ears comfortably\n",
      "If you want to buy real apple headphones make sure they are from amazon or go to the apple store online\n",
      "Not as good as the Android earphones but  then again iPhones are also worse than Androids so that's probably why\n",
      "Great\n",
      "I didn't like the sound quality.\n",
      "Boy do I feel like a chump for not reading the customer reviews... as others have said, these are not genuine Apple headphones as advertised (poo on you Amazon for allowing that!) They are cheap junk - going straight into the garbage can.\n",
      "This s*** broke on the first day.... Don't buy\n",
      "I don't know what's up with all of these fake comments about these EarPods. I mean like, they seller is the Apple... so how in the world can they be fake or anything. These EarPods are the original ones. Thanks!\n",
      "It's great and I can Hear through the music!!\n",
      "Good\n",
      "Fake!\n",
      "They're decent but they're not the real deal.\n",
      "Fab !!!\n",
      "Great sound for now....long term quality unknown\n",
      "It is not original Apple EarPods. Apple products have proper packaging with unmistakable sings of origin. The quality of sound is bad. Do not buy it.\n",
      "These earbuds are garbage. One of the ear buds went out not two months after ordering them!\n",
      "would not order again\n",
      "I really like the bass boost, but you can still tell that these are not as good as the genuine apple pods. They're good for the price.\n",
      "Arrived sooner than expected! Brand new and better than expected! Thank you!!\n",
      "The earbuds broke after only a few weeks of use.  Sound will only come from one earbud.  I have used apple earbuds for a long time, but this pair seemed poorly made.\n",
      "After few weeks only one earphone is working...odd\n",
      "nice\n",
      "Volume adjustment buttons are hit or miss... people on the other end of phone calls hear distracting clicks and static when headphones are plugged in.\n",
      "These do not work ... this is my second time ordering them and one earpiece went out within one day. The same thing happened with my first order.\n",
      "These keep bringing my Siri up randomly on my ipod whenever I have them plugged in and they hurt my ears when I have them in.\n",
      "They broke so easily, i get them 2 weeks ago and then the right earbud stop working and then it fell off  i would not recomend!!!\n",
      "I paid $10 for these bc my Apple ones broke and I was desperate. They work just fine - no issues with the sound. The only complaint I have is that the volume/pause control broke in half so I had to tape together (still works tho). And then today the left earbud cover came off and had to be snapped back together. Minor inconveniences - just keep in mind you get what you pay for.\n",
      "Do not buy: these are alright in the picture only. Sound quality is horrible. Physical quality is worse. Cheap plastic knock off. The only thing I would credit these charlatains with is being able to replicate the shape of the apple ear buds we all love. What a con. Rot in hell.\n",
      "Works great, thank you!\n",
      "Hahahahahahaha people actually pay 29.99 or so for this? Sound quality is trash and the earpods have such a low build quality for this price. Cheap skullcandys can easily surpass these \"buds\". People just care to much about appearance and fashion rather than quality and the content. Sony, skullcandy, sennheiser, bose, audio technica, AKG, beyerdynamic, panasonic, Philips Basically I'm saying everything is better than this. If you've bought these, please consider rethinking your life. Chinese knockoffs are just as good as these.\n",
      "Awesome, of course.\n",
      "Quality is well however the remote does not work at all\n",
      "CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT THESE - I basically order them in packs of 3-5 now.\n",
      "The case that the headphones were in were cracked upon delivery and the cord cracked within a week. Terrible product that's not authentic headphones but very cheap knock off version and my headphones broke within a few weeks so I will not be purchasing any more products from them again!\n",
      "There was clearly earwax in the earbud! These were not new earbuds and I was utterly disgusted! Not acceptable at all.\n",
      "Didn't work. Don't bother.\n",
      "Description said these are Apple earbuds, but I think they're really a knockoff. I bought 2 pairs: 1 didn't work and the other had a poor connection.\n",
      "Work great! Even for androids!\n",
      "I'm sure they will make the tween I ordered them for happy, but I was a little disappointed with the quality.\n",
      "The seller must have changed the product they shipped, because the headphones I received in the mail today were exactly what I expected them to be. They came packaged in unopened Apple packaging. Left and right EarPods are marked as they should be. There are no marks on them or earwax in them, as I had saw old reviews claiming they were \"used.\" They also sound exactly as they should. So far I have absolutely no issues with the product I received.\n",
      "Good replacement for the original. Worth the buy!!\n",
      "I had these for less than a month before they quit working. I wish I had read more reviews. I don't know if these are knock offs or what, but real apple products are reliable. These are not. I will be returning for a refund.\n",
      "Unfortunately the part that goes into the ear and attaches onto the headphones broke after 2 weeks. I still use them, but I have to put them together each time.\n",
      "Best Earbuds You Could Possibly Get I Highly Suggest Them.\n",
      "It's the most horrible headphone that I've ever seen. I just bought it yesterday and it broke in the morning. I haven't used it yet.....!!!!!!!!!\n",
      "Clear reception. Arrived in convient case for travel.\n",
      "The ear buds fit into the ear comfortably. The sound is great. Music sounds clear and true. Conversations sound clear as well, like being in the same room and speaking to someone.\n",
      "Pretty good!!\n",
      "Poor quality. Bought my daughter two pairs for her birthday. The first pair broke within 24 hours, and the second pair was broke within a week.\n",
      "Good one\n",
      "Legit iPhone headphones. Ignore the negative reviews. 100% authenticity.\n",
      "I bought 2 pair of these.  My son used then for 2 days.  He came home and told me that one of the ear pieces had exploded in his ear. Thank goodness there was no injury.  Both in the garbage .\n",
      "Trash don't buy this, don't even waste your time looking at this just buy from someone else because these people suck at the their job thank you\n",
      "They're earpods. They do what they are suppose to do and come in the standard Apple case. They were quick and I am pleased by my order.\n",
      "I took these and compared them against 2 sets that came with 2 different iPhones and they seem to be exactly the same. The sound quality is the same and I've been very pleased with them.\n",
      "these are great.  we use them all the time.\n",
      "I ordered these headphones on June 2, 2016. They were delivered June 8, 2016. When I opened them I tried them out. I instantly noticed that the right earpiece was louder tag the left earpiece. I sat then down for a moment and when I picked them back up the left earpiece started coming apart.\n",
      "These fell apart as they were removed from the packaging. Perhaps compatible with Apple products, but certainly not certified by Apple. Terrible quality.\n",
      "Good\n",
      "I ordered these for my daughter.  She said they sound very clear so was happy with the order.\n",
      "best headsets ever... work forever. went through so many versions of headsets in the past that always failed no matter how expensive... these really last and work great\n",
      "They look real and almost feel real (the cords are too stiff and not as pliant as true Apple earphones), but they sound like you're in a submarine in a tunnel next to a train whooshing by you. Music sounds terrible and using them to talk on the phone makes the person on the other end sound like they are speaking from under a pillow! If you look at my other reviews you will see that I'm a pretty fair dude, but I have to fairly tell you that these headphones are not Apple quality when it comes to audio, not even close! Do not buy them if you need good quality sound. Because they do not provide good quality sound. I would say that the sound they provide is actually quite inhibited and deeply degraded.\n",
      "The buttons on my headphones don't work at all.\n",
      "Within two weeks of purchasing these earbuds, one side stopped working.  They received light to medium use by my teenager who took good and appropriate care of them.  I expected better from a \"genuine\" Apple product. By the time I got around to trying to return them, the return window had closed.\n",
      "I love them there better than the Samsung ear buds\n",
      "1 set of the ear phones malfunctioned, one of the ear buds stopped working after about 1 month :(\n",
      "These aren't anywhere near the level of the apple headphones you can normally buy.  Good for an emergency when you forgot your own headphones though.\n",
      "Horrible quality\n",
      "They had came faster then the day they was suppose to come. They are 100% legit real apple headphones\n",
      "Amazing quality product! Wasn't sure about buying it but I looked thru the reviews and you have to look at the buyer that's fulfilled by amazon for OEM Apple EarPods.\n",
      "These work perfect with the iphone.\n",
      "I do not think these were  authentic your buds! They fell apart very quickly!\n",
      "They were authentic Apple products! They sound the same as the pair i have laying around my house that i recieved with my iPhone!\n",
      "I bought two sets. One set the left ear didn't work. The second set works.\n",
      "GOOD PRODUCT\n",
      "All OK\n",
      "My go to earphones when I'm on the go\n",
      "Happy with my purchase.\n",
      "Out of the box, the sound bounced back and forth between the left and right ears, sometimes staying on the left, sometimes staying on the right. I like the fit, but that was it. I returned them.\n",
      "The volume button on these earbuds does not function. Imitation product. Don't purchase.\n",
      "I have compared it to the real apple earpods and I cannot tell whether the difference. It works really well and seems genuine.\n",
      "these are genuine apple earpods :)\n",
      "I used it as soon as delivered. But left side was not working. so i just applied to refund.\n",
      "these have the apple label in the back of them. I can't tell the difference between these and the ones from my iphone box.\n",
      "Broke within two weeks.\n",
      "Fake EarPods don't get them, i got 2 and i wish i hadn't.\n",
      "I love them\n",
      "Arrived on time and work well.\n",
      "Works really well still and its been a month since i purchased.\n",
      "Got them and the case was completely destroyed. Sound came out perfectly but a week after I bought them the button to control volume stopped working entirely.\n",
      "These apple headphones are my go to with headphones. Very cheap but do the job every time. I even accidentally left them in my clothes when they went through the wash and dryer and they still work great! Love that I can use them to talk to people through the phone as well. I will never pay for the $200 headphones when I can use these and they are so durable.\n",
      "After a month and a half they stopped working, and I used them as a back up, not daily!!!!\n",
      "Apple knock-off extraordinaire.\n",
      "Great deal, serves the purpose.\n",
      "It works just for a month l. After, I have issues with the mic and headsets\n",
      "I didn't receive headphones.\n",
      "New as said, really happy, works great.\n",
      "Get the longer ones you won't regret it. Otherwise works like it's supposed to.\n",
      "Received this on May 18, 2016.  On May 30 my daughter informed me that they fell apart.\n",
      "Really town between a 3 and a 4- I don't recommend for gym use as after a while they tend to breakdown and create GIANT issues with activating your voice command or SIRI. Love the sound quality on these though.\n",
      "These are fake, the microphone barely works, audio is low and subject to interference from wireless phones. Unshielded copper wire. Do not buy. I've attached photos of the internals of this model, and references of what real EarPods looks like internally.\n",
      "They are headphones. nuff said\n",
      "I've had these for roughly a month and the sound went out on one side I want a refund!!!\n",
      "Fake earphones. It says \"Sold by Apple,\" but they are not. Sound quality is off, no bass, tinny.\n",
      "Works great. Appears to be genuine. No issues with the earpods\n",
      "Comfortable and good quality.\n",
      "It was quick and product matches the exact description\n",
      "The microphone didn't work out of the packaging and I can't hear anything out of them after using them for three days.  Worthless.\n",
      "Expensive\n",
      "They broke after two weeks\n",
      "The original.\n",
      "So I've had an Apple EarPods when I first got my iPhone but one day couldn't find them, and other headphones don't satisfied me and I didn't want to pay $30 for another Apple EarPods. I went in search on Amazon and came across these, in the description it claims to be origional EarPods made by Apple. I was scepital about it because they were so cheap. Well let me tell you they are 100% made by Apple, because It has the Apple ingravements on the wire, (Designed by Apple in California). I recommend you buying them because who knows how long it will last for the price.\n",
      "I love my headphones they were cheap and have great quality. however I lost them the same day.\n",
      "Very nice new headphones\n",
      "I ordered two of these - both crackle and pop when I move. One pair only works in the right ear. Not sure if these are knock offs or refurbed, but they definitely not as good as the earbuds that you spend 30$ on.\n",
      "Volume buttons were broken soon as I recieved it. Other than that, quality earbuds.\n",
      "Don't believe these are apple earbuds. Look almost exact, but the remote doesn't control iPhones.  Also the wire coating isn't the same as Apple.\n",
      "Good job.!\n",
      "Not quality apple headphones\n",
      "Broke within 3 weeks.  The EarPods which came with my phone lasted well over a year before one ear stopped producing sound.  Since then I have went through several off brand apple like EarPods.  The others I have has last 2 to 3 months and then something happens and they stop working.  These were not good at all.  with in three weeks the sound stopped, a few days later the left pod just fell off the wire.\n",
      "The headphones were authentic Apple headphones and all functionality worked with my iPhone 6 with a good price. Would buy again.\n",
      "bad quality , it is not an original . bad sound , bad disegn\n",
      "good\n",
      "Only one side works. Very disappointed.\n",
      "Sound is okay. But this obviously a rip off\n",
      "I love these earbuds and I'm going to see Ghostbusters (2016) very soon :)\n",
      "exactly like the real thing.\n",
      "So far so good. Everything about them works pretty well. Can't help but being sceptical that they're not actually Apple but nothing about my experience with them have led me to think that they're not.\n",
      "I like them. Its been about a week and sound quality is still great and they havent broken. I havent seen anyproblems so far.\n",
      "Love my earbuds !! Plain and simple\n",
      "Bought for son.  Two pair.  Both broke within a few days.  He says no way these are Apple...\n",
      "These feel real but I don't know, after having them for a while the volume consistently goes down by itself and it's difficult to pause my music with the button, I skate and I don't know if bunching it in my pocket has to do anything with it.\n",
      "These are fake.\n",
      "The control buttons are broken after less than a month. Totally not worth. Extremely poor quality.\n",
      "Great headphones\n",
      "One of the ear buds stopped working within 2 weeks\n",
      "My son just LOVES these!!  I also checked out the sound and they are clear as a bell!  For the price, these little gems are worth the listen!\n",
      "These are not OEM. The ear buds are not smooth and look like they were painted over. Mine have a few rough spots that make them uncomfortable to put inside my ear.\n",
      "Great, Wonderful sound! I see all these people claiming these to be fake, But the reality is that they were not careful. Be sure to find a good seller before you buy these earpods. I got mine from a seller that's called Estock and these definitely are real. If the Plus and Minus on the buttons are Black, Than there are fake, they should be silver. Also, if they come in different colors, remember that Apple only makes White earpods (And real Earpods of course). Oh and be sure it does not ship DIRECTLY from China.\n",
      "Totally recommend this.\n",
      "Apple headphones is what I ordered and got.\n",
      "They came already dirty and it clearly said that they were NEW.....\n",
      "This is a knockoff and it fell apart within 35 days, the buttons don't feel the same as the genuine item I got with my iPhone and the caps of the pods simply fell off in my pocket and tore the wire for the headphones so they don't work anymore.\n",
      "I've had these for 5 months, and they already started wearing down! The sound is distorted and whatever I listen to sounds like it's coming from under water. Very disappointed at the low quality. :/\n",
      "Like the headline says, these give me nonstop crackling sides with every tiny movement of the wire. And the remote only works occasionally. Don't waste your money.\n",
      "Crackly, hollow sound, and cheap feeling. Not a quality product, definitely not worthy of the Apple name. Shame on me for not reading more carefully.\n",
      "Great sound\n",
      "Did not have the headphones for 2 weeks before they stopped working.!!!!\n",
      "Note: I don't fault this seller for the defective headphones, these things happen occasionally, and the other headphones I bought work fine.\n",
      "Just as described. Very low price for quality headphones.\n",
      "I've had a lot apple headphones in my lifetime and I know the quality of them and the one time I buy  them on Amazon, I expected them to disappoint me. the sound quality is horrible and people can hear your music. plus they don't even get loud enough and when it's all the way the up it hurts your ears. don't recommend\n",
      "aaa\n",
      "I have tried other earbuds and I always hate I can hear ambient noise. Not with these little babies! I sometimes forget there are other people in the room. I love that I don't have to turn them up all the way to hear my music / you tube videos. They are a bit pricier than other earbuds, but it's for a good reason.\n",
      "Work great\n",
      "I received what I ordered the only problem I have is one side of my ear buds work\n",
      "These aren't the same quality as the actual Apple headphones.  If the chord is moved in certain positions, the connection cuts out for half a second.  Otherwise, everything works just the same\n",
      "It had a shortage when I got them you have to turn the headphones a certain way. It also had a wierd purfume smell as well it was ah little greasy\n",
      "Original\n",
      "Solid earphones\n",
      "Sound quality is incredible. Better than some $40 headphones I have.\n",
      "Do not buy. Less than a month old and the left ear has stopped working. No damage or wear and tear. Just stopped working. Bad buy.\n",
      "Looks perfect!! Sound is also good! Worth for the money!! Go ahead and buy\n",
      "I bought these from TRG but the order was fulfilled by Amazon.  They are counterfeits.  The volume and selector buttons don't work.  The sound is a bit muddy with too much base.  They do have the exact shape buds so they fit well in my ears.  And they look exactly like real Apple earbuds.\n",
      "These earphones didn't even last me a month and they blew out. Sucks that I can't return them.\n",
      "good\n",
      "These are the real deal!\n",
      "Cheap knock off earbuds. They claim that they're the same ones that apple sells, and they look very much like the ones apple sells, but the sound quality is completely different. Garbage.\n",
      "Ones of better headphones out here on the market way better then androidor any competitors.The design fits all ears and very securely. When I use these headphones for the gym I never have to adjust them just pop them and go no more every second putting them back in. The headphones are pretty durable don't go for the cheap knock offs. Yes the head phones do come with the mic and it is not the best Mic but it is really good for a 12 dollar headphone.  Overall I would definitely recommend to any one also who ever is reading this review its worth the buy trust me.\n",
      "Crap !!! after 2 days of use , no balance at all .. The left ear bud doesnt have any sound compared to the right ear bud.\n",
      "Good product as advertised; new!  Ordered twice ... Very satisfied both times.  High quality, prompt service\n",
      "Mine arrived damaged, clearly they had not been well-refurbished. They also felt way cheaper than the Apple Certified headphones. Do not buy!\n",
      "Counterfeit. Do not buy. Product broke within first day of use. Not apple product.\n",
      "Sound great and looks great!\n",
      "Nice earpod. Arrived on time. Thanks\n",
      "These arrived and they are absolutely not \"original\" Apple headphones as they were advertised.  They are cheap copies, terrible sound, basically garbage.\n",
      "Works good\n",
      "Better than Apple prices!\n",
      "Excellent product.  Arrived in original Apple packaging.\n",
      "Just received this like 3 days ago and the left earphone already stopped working. Then the next day the price dropped $3\n",
      "garbage\n",
      "Only used them once and one of the ear buds stoped working\n",
      "Awesome headphones. Can't wear them for long periods of time without soreness. Great sound quality!\n",
      "Bad audio quality.\n",
      "This is not a legitimate product. The product works fine for the first few weeks . Then either one of the ear buds will get less volume or it will go completely blank. Dont get your hopes of having a long lasting product after seeing it for first few days. I should have listened to other reviews or should have brought a legitimate apple earbuds.\n",
      "These were great and still is great, I was not disappointed!\n",
      "Don't know why people say that they are fake.  The  ones I got were good and the sound quality was great. Don't know why people are giving bad reviews\n",
      "Love these headphones! Solid sound and fit nicely into the ear without being too intrusive...\n",
      "Fake\n",
      "Worked perfectly fine\n",
      "Honestly just wanted some apple earphones as good quality as the ones that came in with my iPhone 6s but sadly I compared both headphones back to back same part of the song with the same volume and the apple earphones were so much more clear and the bass quality is way better than these earphones that I had thought were Apple. The wires on these were also not as thick and felt more cheap. I would love to send it back but I'm not going through that hassle for $12. I'm going to just refer to those who enjoy earphones and listening to music a lot to just go to the store and get apple headphones. I decided to take the chance here seeing that there were a lot of good comments, but sadly I'm disappointed! Hope this helps out anyone who is put in the same situation as me and wants a truthful review!\n",
      "To cheap did not work I returned theme\n",
      "Fake.\n",
      "I love this phone case so much. It has replaced my purse for most outings and it's pretty and convenient. It actually holds a lot of cards and paper, but will open easily if it's too full (duh!). Used as it should be, it protects the phone from falls, it's still light enough, and easy to hold. It's a bit slippery when new, but that wears of quickly. I get tons of compliments and people are always asking me where I got it. I love that I can still use my camera with the case on and not have the flap to hold open.\n",
      "Cheap knockoff. Not Apple product as advertised. Totally fake.\n",
      "This is fake don't buy it trust me on this save your money.\n",
      "Earphones are terrible quality. Poor sound. So bad\n",
      "The headphones does not look like original and one side was broken. Tha picture attached.\n",
      "These are the same ones that come with the iPhone, or at least they are identical. The sound quality is the same and they work exactly the same. Everyone is aware Apple products don't have the best reputation for durability so I will update this review in a couple of months, but so far, so good!\n",
      "The headphones were great quality and definitely the style from Apple, but after only a month one of the headphones stopped working with no apparent signs of a broken wire or anything.\n",
      "this product is not original\n",
      "Okay so my cats have  suddenly become obsessed with eating anything that looks like a wire ! I swear buying them the pull an play treats ( like Twizzlers for cats)which do look like wire to our near color blind feline friends has caused this and so I ordered my first replacement which was just the white plastic holder box not original Packing box which I expected since buying from Apple- They arrived worked fine for a day then I noticed the wiring around the plug that goes into your phone or iPad was for a lack of better description floppy not stiff and sturdy and sure as can be when I removed it from one item to the next- it had a short or? I could be sitting not moving and all of a sudden it was signaling Siri and I would hear \" Sorry I didn't get that \" so upset that these didn't last 24 hours I had every intention of returning them when low and behold leaving them for two minutes to go get the plastic case - my cat bit thru them - so there went that money down the drain. I took the loss and reordered another pair and these arrived in the original seated Apple outer box then the plastic case was inside it. I felt much better about them ! Also learned my lesson got a case to put them in so kitty couldn't eat them! Worked well for about a week and same problem with that section by the plug that goes into your device. I am an avid Apple customer but not with the head sets. I really like the ergonomic ear plug vs buds and so again had the intention to return and YES don't ask me how as I couldn't figure it out I swear I never took my eyes off them but somehow kitty got a bite in so that was that.  Please no haters or negative remarks about my kitty cat - my fault from the get go but in any event beware of the wiring around the device plug it is just not up to par for an Apple product. The first picture is of the way the plug area should look you can see its sturdy and upright  these are someone else's that had no problems --  The second picture you can see where its bending and floppy. Don't know how to end this other than say less the kitty cats seems there truly is a problem with the plug area. I gave three stars because when they first worked sound quality was great - Microphone was great - Being an Apple added the third Star but that's being generous.\n",
      "i really do love this apple earpods, everytime i have a new gadgets i always use the apple earpods, not because it has a great sounds, but the way it looks like... clean and smooth.. recommended to others eventhough your an android users.. 5start for this.. :)\n",
      "I bought these headphones in April and I think they were delivered around April 29.  I went on a trip to Washington DC and the following week and they were broken.  I didn't do anything to them except plug them in my phone and they wouldn't play sound.  I was very disappointed.  I'm not sure if it was just my pair of headphones because normally these headphone are very nice and good quality.  but my pair broke within the first 2 weeks I owned them I was very angry that I paid for headphones that can't even last a month\n",
      "NOT a real Apple product  Its really thin and it has a brittle feel to it\n",
      "ok\n",
      "I would give zero if I can. This is a horrible product. When the music is playing there's a lot background noise, and the volume control does not work at all. Unfortunately I found out these problem little over a month, so I can't return it now. Well, please read the reviews and avoid buying from this seller\n",
      "Everything seems fine and everything is working. Really good audio.\n",
      "FAKE HEADPHONES! Absolutely horrible sound quality, and especially bass. If you ordered these and are unsure of the authenticity, search online how to tell the difference for apple earpods. Its extremely easy to figure out if they are fake or not.\n",
      "It did meet my expectations\n",
      "I don't know if I lucked out, but if the earpods I got are counterfeit, they are the best counterfeits I've ever seen. The plastic and other materials very closely match a set of official Apple earpods that came with my iPhone. If anything, perhaps Apple decided to use a slightly different mixture of polymers for their plastic, since the new ones seem a little different. But it could just be from wear and tear of the older ones.\n",
      "After a week of good care, the left ear broke....I'm incredibly frustrated.\n",
      "These are not Apple branded. These are cheap knockoffs that come in a package with the Apple logo. They're really really low quality.\n",
      "Stopped working after 3 weeks of light use.\n",
      "VERY GOOD PRODUCT.\n",
      "Legit apple headphones kind of skeptical at first but once they arrived I was convinced that they were what the pictures depicted.\n",
      "Not original\n",
      "Although not genuine, audio quality is very good and superior to what you would think of a \"generic\" pair. They look identical to genuine apple ear pods and function just as well. From a quality control perspective, my pair had a jammed volume control and inline controls were mainly used for play/pause functionality. The durability of these are also comparable to genuine ear pods, meaning they last until they don't.  If anything, this speaks more to the design choice than theses specif pair of earphones (as even Apple can't seem to produce adequate durability). Overall, a decent buy and does a good job if you don't want to pay 3x the price for the genuine article.\n",
      "good\n",
      "WYSIWYG. Perfect!\n",
      "Fake. Do not be deceived by the name of the product. THIS ARE NOT APPLE EARPODS. Fake! Don't waste your money on this.\n",
      "WORKED FINE QUICK SHIP\n",
      "Fits ok.  Will monitor as these have a tendency to separate at the junction where they meet.\n",
      "Do not buy these unless they are from the Apple store. They don't sound as clear and deep. They sounf hollow and cheap like a fake.\n",
      "THANKS\n",
      "As described. Fast shipping.\n",
      "Awesome. Fast shipping! Works great!\n",
      "Only had my headphones a day and they broke. I don't recommend this product. Definitely wasn't worth the 7 bucks\n",
      "The ear phones work, but the case is cracked.\n",
      "Clear sound, ear pieces fit well and the caller on the other end hears you just fine even in convertible with the top down\n",
      "Fake !!!!!\n",
      "I have ordered these headphones THREE separate times and each pair, after a couple of weeks, ends up malfunctioning. Every single pair I've bought from amazon doesn't work after three weeks, specifically, the LEFT headphone doesn't work each time i've bought it from amazon. I just ordered apple headphones from Apple instead\n",
      "Fake and terrible sound quality. I own an authentic pair that don't compare in terms of quality. I want a refund\n",
      "Arrived defective. Control only able to raise and lower volume.  Unable to pause, play, skip song, accept or end calls. Must be a fake apple product.\n",
      "These are horrible, they are totally fake and sound like garbage DO NOT BUY\n",
      "Best earbuds ever! Love these.  Even after giving my son the ones that came with 2 iPhones and my iPad and having to buy these...I'm still happy.\n",
      "I was pretty much confused about the negative reviews I have come across in the review section. But, this product is original. I have checked it with all those procedures to check whether it is duplicate or not. It's working fine now. By the way, I will let you guys know if the product has got any defects or not. 5 Stars for the product right now. I had 2 ear pods before. It's pretty much the same. So, Don't get confused with all these reviews. Just go ahead with it. This is the Best Seller of Amazon.\n",
      "So today I bought REAL EarPods from the Apple Store and thought I'd write a review on what I'm glad I threw away.... They FAKE. I could tell from the second I started listening to music, the bass doesn't compare to the bass of ACTUAL Apple EarPods. Siri gone wack so many times with these while I was running it was just so annoying, and after the first day, the remote and volume buttons stopped working! You've got to be kidding me -__- I'd give it 0 stars if I could.\n",
      "Perfect\n",
      "Genuine Apple Earphones. Was skeptical of some of the comments cause they mentioned quality; but these are real.\n",
      "It worked great\n",
      "aaa ty\n",
      "can't have my clinic practics done without these bands as i sweat a lot.\n",
      "One earpod louder than the other.\n",
      "ok\n",
      "The left side earpiece does not work consistently. It goes on and off. Very disappointed.\n",
      "Much better than my previous Apple ear buds (fit better in the ear) though the chord/wire is a bit thicker. Excellent sound quality.\n",
      "Great!\n",
      "Love them, use them everyday with no issues.\n",
      "A good decision.\n",
      "The left earbud works better than the right one. It took me a while to notice it.\n",
      "I like having a pair of apple headphones around. Great price, was worth the purchase.\n",
      "OK!\n",
      "It has broken within 1 week of use, so fake and not well made\n",
      "Not real but really great! The wiring is thinner than the original apple headphones but I've never had them break on me. I just keep losing em haha.\n",
      "Only one side works!\n",
      "I usually buy rip off China EarPods but these were so affordable I couldn't pass them up. Way better quality and the inline mic and volume are super helpful.\n",
      "Original.\n",
      "I bought 2 and both microphones didn't work\n",
      "I like it\n",
      "The EarPods worked well for about one week then the EarPods with the mic just stopped working! Will not repurchase through this site!\n",
      "Had ear wax in it. Gross.\n",
      "original\n",
      "As expected, good quality.\n",
      "They are not working already !!\n",
      "the left bud stopped working barely a month in\n",
      "It new and it works . no Gimicks\n",
      "Very nice headphones! The feel of them is different from the Apple ones, but the sound quality is fantastic. The bass is good also! Will be buying these again! I've accidentally put these in the washer two times, and they still work great!! Would highly recommend, especially for teenagers that are forgetful.\n",
      "My favorite EarPods.  I use them all the time and they work great.\n",
      "Nice!\n",
      "Audio quality was really bad which I don't expect from original ear phones\n",
      "These are actually real and work really well. The sound isn't tinny and they are a lot cheaper than buying from apple. I was a little worried with all the bad reviews saying they were fake but these are definitely real and work super well!! They don't fall out when I'm running and look very sleek. They come in the Apple case and are very good replacements. All the music sounds really good and the bass is good.\n",
      "These are Apple earbuds!  You'd pay $55 at the Apple store!\n",
      "Really good\n",
      "The shipping part took long, other than that my EarPods are good\n",
      "Great quality\n",
      "Great\n",
      "I love it. and it works very well.\n",
      "Great buy! Happy with the product \n",
      "Nothing like the real thing! I love this headset. It fits and it lasts through all my travels and rough usage. When my bluetooth headset dies in the middle of the day, this still works. When I want to listen to music on the plane, this is my go to headset.\n",
      "Great Quality and On Time\n",
      "These are not iPhone head phones. They are a cheap knock off and you can tell by the quality. Even the actual earbud quality is cheap plastic. The sound quality is not the same as apple. DON'T BUY!!!! unless you like these type of things.\n",
      "Sound is ok but my buttons do not work I don't know if it's just mine or all of them\n",
      "EarPods broke within one day of use. terrible quality\n",
      "My older sister loves her apple headphones and they're good quality.\n",
      "I love the remote and microphone feature.  It allows for seamless transition from listening to music to answering a phone call without having to take the headphones out of the phone.  It fits comfortably in the ear and does not easily fall out so I can do almost any task while listening to music or talking on the phone.\n",
      "Audio is disorientated if moved slightly from head phone jack. Not worth the money\n",
      "Great sound for such a little price. Not the best for walking or working out, however\n",
      "Just as expected, had them before. work great\n",
      "Works fine. Don't be fooled by others that got the bad one out of a billion.\n",
      "Please DO NOT buy these they are not apple headphones at all the wires are very small and they look like they will break very easily.\n",
      "Was skeptical after reading reviews but they work great and are 100% percent real. They also came quicker than expected.\n",
      "The cheapest headphones in the world\n",
      "Its really good for the price\n",
      "These are exactly what they say they are!! Absolutely perfect!! These are actual Apple earpods\n",
      "I received authentic Apple EarPods that failed within a month.  After I contacted BlueTek, they sent me replacement EarPods no questions asked.  Very satisfied!\n",
      "At first the product worked really well and looked just like the one that came with my iPhone but after just a few weeks the wires have already started to show through\n",
      "Likr\n",
      "Worked exactly as expected but cheaper than going to the Apple Store\n",
      "SUCH great quality for the price. I really can't tell a difference, and it's been a few months.\n",
      "Good quality headphones. The volume buttons don't work however, but that's a common issue with Android and Apple headphones that I expected. Overall good.\n",
      "Works great\n",
      "These work great! They're just like the headphones that came with my iphone. Now I can keep a set with my laptop and keep a set in my purse!\n",
      "It's fake and trash don't buy\n",
      "good sound\n",
      "Mine came in just the carrying case. They were brand new. They are real Apple Ear pods. For $10 they are very good. Last year I bought them for $30. Not worth $30. But worth $10.\n",
      "I thought these were just a really good deal on OEM Apple Earbuds. Nope. They look like the real thing, but they are not. I use these for teleconferences so I can be hands-free--but guess what? No one can hear me--the mic stinks. I thought it must be lint or something in my phone, but then I did a voice memo test--when I recorded using the earbuds I can barely hear myself, 10 times louder using the iPhones internal mic. Of course I waited until too late to return them now, so I spent $14 on earbuds that I can use to listen, but not speak. Don't buy these if you want to use the mic.\n",
      "Do not buy these. They are not real \"Apple\" EarPods. Buyer beware.\n",
      "Perfect and much cheaper than buying direct from Apple!\n",
      "It said I was receiving a used pair of EarPods that weren't broken and were cleaned out and tested.... THATS A LIE!!! I received a broken set of EarPods, one of the EarPods have a short in them so it comes out of one ear only and the volume control buttons don't work!\n",
      "I bought these after the volume adjuster stopped working on the pair that came with my iPhone. After a few months of daily use including runs in sometimes rainy conditions, these are still going strong.\n",
      "They're not authentic Apple iPhone earphones. Just by the look alone I could tell, and the sound isn't of the Apple standard I'm used to.\n",
      "My favorite headphones. The audio quality is of course great, but the style of these earbuds is the most comfortable I've ever had. I forget I have them in.\n",
      "I bought these headphones in the beginning of April and they broke by the first week in May. I was very skeptical when I got them but gave them a shot. They were very rigid and felt like they were made of a harder plastic and the volume switch stopped working after about 3 weeks and the left earbud stopped working the next week. I wouldn't go for these again.\n",
      "The ear pods don't fit my ears.\n",
      "Good price for Apple ear buds.  Work well\n",
      "fake\n",
      "They work great.Love them!!I put the volume all the way up,and after many months they still work!!\n",
      "Trash. I bought two and both mics stopped working about a week into using them. Sound is ok/good, but you can't use them to communicate!\n",
      "I haven't had any problems with hearing from theses EarPods. However they do feel a little generic.\n",
      "the quality was less than I expected, yet based on the price paid, they work fine. my hope was that they would be as close of Apple OEM as possible.\n",
      "Just love it. So comfortable, you barely feel it, sound is perfect and at the same time you are are of your surrounding.\n",
      "Exact replacement which was all I wanted.\n",
      "These are not Apple OEM headphones.... cord material is plastic feeling instead of sticky rubber.\n",
      "These are awesome earpods!  Genuine Apple product! I've bought offbrand earbuds before that would have static or poor sound quality, but nothing like that with these!\n",
      "Great and really clear EarPods.\n",
      "GreAt\n",
      "Awesome buy\n",
      "\n",
      "Got these after the ear buds fell off my old ones, these don't have earbuds so that will never be an issue. Does the job, fits quite comfortably.\n",
      "exactly what i was expecting. Great service.\n",
      "Shipped quickly and works great\n",
      "Great product.\n",
      "it's a hit and miss with these kind of things. the pair i received makes the audio sound very hollow and far away, especially when i listen to music. not good...\n",
      "These are the only earbuds that we use.... They fit the our ears perfectly. (our ear canals are smaller than usual)\n",
      "Not Apple headphones fake third party very dissatisfied with this and disappointed\n",
      "Fake\n",
      "Quick and good\n",
      "One of the earpods did not work\n",
      "They Stopped working. After two days.\n",
      "Great Quality! It sounds clear,crisp and loud. I was hesitant to buy it due to some bad reviews, but I bought it and came just as expected.\n",
      "Great quality!\n",
      "DO NOT BUY THESE EARBUDS.\n",
      "Not Apple.\n",
      "Only one earbud works. I would like new ones.\n",
      "They are identical to the Apple EarPods physically and technologically.\n",
      "I ordered like 3 sets of this earbuds and they sound pretty good for the price but eventually they fall apart. I consider myself a person that takes pretty good care of this kind of stuff but couldn't help them last any longer. Ordered like 2 or 3 months ago and they are all gone already. \n",
      "Perfect\n",
      "Always a great product!\n",
      "they blew out very quickly.\n",
      "I was skeptical, but they're genuine in every way I can measure!\n",
      "Not recommended. One of the ear buds didn't function right out of the box.\n",
      "as described\n",
      "I wanted to get some ear phones that were similar to Apple ear phones. I found these ear phones on Amazon and they were a great price so I decided to get them.\n",
      "Works perfectly\n",
      "Great headphones I recommend it .\n",
      "It met all of my expectations, the sound quality is perfect and the bass is good too. these are original and mine game in an iPhone earbudd case. there's nothing I don't like\n",
      "They're exactly the same as the ones that came with my phone, except they're way cheaper!\n",
      "I returned these after the first use!  There was a crackling noise when I plugged them into my iPhone and then during a walk, they actually started shocking my ears!!!  Don't buy them!\n",
      "Do not work! Static in ear after a while!  The static or spark is so strong that it caused pain in my ear! Never buying again! I bought almost 4 sets. I thought it was me but it was fake apple headphones.\n",
      "The microphone quit working after 6 weeks!  I doubt these are genuine Apple.  Maybe refurbished.  Don't waste your money.\n",
      "Junk. One ear bud lost sound with < a week of use.\n",
      "These came defective, one earbud was always scratchy sounding & they broke shortly thereafter.\n",
      "My old ones that came with my Samsung phone were showing wear. These are perfect replacement - the real thing.\n",
      "Never order again. Receive shock in ears from any type of static.\n",
      "I regret buying these. Volume doesn't work anymore. Does not skip songs. I guess you get what you pay for.\n",
      "***BUYER BEWARE*** they are not an authentic apple product. The sound quality is bad. I figured maybe I recieved one out of a million that recieved a defective item but when you buy two and both have bad sound quality and both sounds terrible when speaking to someone over the phone well then It safe to say this is not an authentic Apple product. Do not buy.\n",
      "Wonderful great quality\n",
      "These are fake. No way around it. I've seen people write about the \"R\" on the right bud being worn off and the same thing happened to mine. The sound isn't full and rich like normal Apple earpods are. The right pod actually split in half, but it did pop back in. The \"netting\" on the earpods both came off and now there's just a hole where the sound comes out. Also, the plastic part on the 3.5mm jack came out of place. These are just very crappy headphones and I'm appalled that Amazon still has these as not only a prime item, but the first result when you type in \"apple earpods\"\n",
      "Yes they are great\n",
      "I ordered these for my iPhone 6 Plus....I really like them. Having the option to turn up or down the volume without taking my phone out of the case is such a treat for me!!  Price is great!\n",
      "These are just your average earbuds. That come with phone. A good way to replace lost earbuds.\n",
      "Best earphones in terms of resistance to wear and tear.\n",
      "These are fake, for sure. I knew when I opened the package that they weren't real. No Apple logo anywhere and the feel is different from the real thing. They worked so I decided to give them a try but within 2 days, the on/off button stopped working. I'm returning them to Amazon.\n",
      "Yes I love my earpods\n",
      "My son loves these.\n",
      "I brought several pair and a couple of then have broken.  The cable is not the same quality as the original ones\n",
      "wtf is this crap, i ordered it on it didnt even work\n",
      "These were consistantly advertised as authentic Apple earbuds and are clearly not. Even arrives with Apple logos and brags about its authenticity.  Broke the second time I've used them. Sound quality is trash. This should be illegal.\n",
      "As soon as I opened, the cover to the remote and mic fell off, completely disappointed!!!\n",
      "Good price and good quality.\n",
      "I've only had them for a couple of days, but so far so good! sound quality is great\n",
      "No complaints just make sure u keep up with them becuause they are easy to lose\n",
      "Perfect! Arrived in no time.\n",
      "It's a gift for my friend, she likes it so much\n",
      "do not work\n",
      "excellent product works amazing!\n",
      "Occasionally shocks my ears with a slight electrical current which is not pleasant\n",
      "Great ear buds.  Incredible sound.  would buy again.\n",
      "what's not to love?\n",
      "Right side stopped working within a month and I cannot contact the seller to replace for whatever reason.\n",
      "Great!\n",
      "I guess I got lucky because I got legit apple earbuds. I compared them to a pair that came with the new iPhone and the sound and build quality are identical, thus legit. I would be interested in who people are buying the fake pairs from. I got mine from OEM Battery.\n",
      "Excelente\n",
      "i love it works fine\n",
      "works great\n",
      "Its absolutley great i only wish it was longer\n",
      "Exactly as expected.\n",
      "Great product the headphones sound great and I will come here and buy this same one next time I'm in need of another pair\n",
      "Great sound, works with my iPad and Galaxy Note 3 phone. I really like the way these fit in my ear.\n",
      "These are the best earbuds in the world. They are small and portable. They give away great sound and are very easy to use. The remote is so helpful and I would recommend this produce a thousand times!!!\n",
      "Sound is good, BUT THE RIGHT BUD BARELY GETS INTO YOUR EAR, WHILE THE LEFT DOES! NO SOUND OUT OF THE RIGHT BUD IS HEARD UNLESS YOU BLAST IT!\n",
      "Awesome product! I was scared for them to have been knock offs and they totally weren't! I broke mine a few weeks before and was super sad and didn't want to buy knock offs! Thank you so much for the honest product that was shipped super fast!\n",
      "Love them as long as I don't wash them in my pants/shorts pocket\n",
      "Satisfied\n",
      "These lit asf\n",
      "Haven't had not one problem out of them. Great sound!\n",
      "BUYER BEWARE!\n",
      "very durable\n",
      "After reading all the reviews, I was very hesitant to even buy these, but when I ended up buying these headphones they actually were the real apple headphones. Pretty sure I got lucky, and whoever sells these should get the legit ones in and stop scamming others.\n",
      "Great great\n",
      "Just received my earpods. Couldnt be happier. Came in original apple case and quality is the same.\n",
      "No problem whatsoever. They are the original i Phone ear phones.\n",
      "One of the headphones went out 3 days after getting them :(\n",
      "Poor sound quality\n",
      "Not genuine; broke within 20 dayd*.\n",
      "I would give this garbage -100 stars if I could! It's cheap knockoff junk, they look and feel cheap. Not only that! I didn't even have to wear them, they fell apart in the palm of my hand!\n",
      "I bought these for my wife because she has always wanted ear buds from Apple. They work great.\n",
      "Apple is the top of the line. Full of exceptional quality and sound. If you want to hear music with every chord pronounced purchase the best-Apple EarPods you will not be disappointed!\n",
      "The mic doesn't work. Defective earphones!! I should've bought them at the Apple Store.\n",
      "Not so very happy with these... They broke after a week...\n",
      "Sound quality is great\n",
      "I was not sure of these when I bought them because I read a lot of negative reviews including people saying they were not Apple.  When I received them they ARE definitely Apple EarPods. Came in the same case as the other set I had, work perfectly and have not had an issue. Definitely a reasonable price as well compared to stores.  For those who are complaining about them not working or broken within a day or so before writing a review - CONTACT THE SELLER/AMAZON!! They will refund your money or send a new set.\n",
      "Yes they are perfect and are great sound.\n",
      "Some of the reviews frightened me after I had already purchased.  I was afraid these weren't legit Apple headphones and some stated the bass was nonexistent while using these.  All I can say is those who bought directly from Amazon seem to be satisfied.  My headphones are definitely legit and they sound great.  Buy direct from Amazon, don't stress.\n",
      "I have product 2 weeks and it is already broken. One of the earphones does not work and the other one only works on some occasions. I was very disappointed with this product since I had the presumption that it would be of relatively high quality which is often associated with Apple products\n",
      "Plug was faulty on arrival, headphones died after a week\n",
      "Cheap Apple headphones and they work great. I love them! I will always come here when i need new headphones when the current pair im using breaks or get stolen or even lost.\n",
      "When it arrived, only one head phone worked...\n",
      "They work fine, lame as reviews smh\n",
      "Love\n",
      "I just recieved this item, it's definitely not real Apple Ear pods but they sound just as good. You will feel the difference. However, for the price, they work just as good.\n",
      "This is my second pair, one for work & one for home.\n",
      "Didn't work from the get go!  Do not purchase these!\n",
      "The remote to lower the volune did not work.\n",
      "Perfect.  Exactly what my son needed for his iPhone.\n",
      "Terrible. I'm not sure how these are allowed to be advertised as an Apple product when they're clearly not made by Apple. The volume controls on my pair did not work and the max volume was at about 20% of what my original Apple headphone could do. I couldn't make out anything during a walk outside if a car drove by, they're that quiet. Junk, tossed in the trash.\n",
      "I'm enjoying my EarPods Thank you\n",
      "These are not apple headphones. Quality is okay, material sucks\n",
      "VERY SATISFIED WITH MY ORDER.\n",
      "Poor quality\n",
      "Just as I would expect and wish they were waterproof then we would not have to keep buying them when they are washed in the washing machine\n",
      "These headphones are trash\n",
      "They were perfect and original\n",
      "Excellent!\n",
      "Coo product....most of the reviews say these things suck...mine work perfectly fine and sound good.\n",
      "these are not OEM, they are advertised as so but are not\n",
      "indeed it is apple ear-pod in original box. Good buy and good deal.\n",
      "worth every dollar, if you want a legitimate set of apple headphone for a third of the retail price, then buying this is definitely a no-brainer.\n",
      "Love it .\n",
      "These are not made from Apple. These are a fake knock off brand. The price is too good to be true. The left ear bud didn't even work. Do not buy!!!\n",
      "My apple headphones I got with my iPhone had a life of about 9 months and were used constantly... The ones I bought on Amazon lasted I don't know about a month... One speaker went out and the remote constantly stops and skips songs.. People write in the review that they are not real Apple headphones.. I think they are but they're just defective...  Extremely dissatisfied...\n",
      "The earpods look nice however 2 of the 4 pairs that I ordered broke within a few days of wearing them.  The pieces that go into your ears came apart and would not stay together.  I was so sad......\n",
      "very good\n",
      "Good\n",
      "Thank You so much!\n",
      "Good one\n",
      "I never write reviews for things but these are awful. They sound worse than my dollar store earbuds and the mic hardly works.\n",
      "Worked exactly like expected, great!\n",
      "We bought 4 pairs and 3 broke within the first 2 weeks. You obviously get what you pay for.\n",
      "Does not have a mic and poor sound quality. Definitly not authentic apple earpods\n",
      "Okay... i have been a long time fan of Apple products, but this time the tables turn...\n",
      "This product really awesome\n",
      "not real apple earphones. i hear static after 2 weeks\n",
      "Great sound\n",
      "The sound is very tinny and thin. I don't think these are really Apple headphones\n",
      "These may not be original Apple headphones, but they work great. I usually have really bad luck when it comes to headphones, but I bought this two years ago and I haven't needed to replace it until now. Great buy!\n",
      "3 weeks, and they're totally trash, music being constantly interrupted by a bunch of pausing, volume adjusting and random activation's of voice command! Do yourself a favor and don't get these from Amazon\n",
      "Excellent product.\n",
      "work perfect so far.\n",
      "Works great\n",
      "Fake. Not really Apple\n",
      "Loved them. Thank You!\n",
      "No issues with this replacement headset.\n",
      "The EarPods damaged in less than three days\n",
      "This is false advertising. Shouldn't this be illegal? Definitely not apple product.\n",
      "All these people saying there product is bad but I got my package perfect and fast. There were no scratches and they were clean. Nothing broken and I've been using them for awhile and there still good.\n",
      "Works well\n",
      "Works well.  May have slightly lower fidelity than the originals.\n",
      "It's definitely not real apple product. I bought one and the quality is terrible comparing to my real one. Don't buy!!\n",
      "These fit better than the regular EarPods.\n",
      "Won't stay in my ears\n",
      "These are FAKE and not real apple products. Real Apple products say made by Apple on the wite along with other information.\n",
      "Great!\n",
      "This is not a genuine product.\n",
      "They are very loud and work great\n",
      "Just what I wanted\n",
      "They were broken when i got them, one of the buds were cut off and half of the volume button was gone.\n",
      "Such great headphones!\n",
      "I was extremely unhappy with my purchase. As soon as I tried the headphones, one of them was broken.\n",
      "It's nice , sound is good\n",
      "For the ones that think they are fake, they are the REAL APPLE EARPODS. They sound exactly like the real ones if they are not.\n",
      "Kids are always loosing these...nice to find them cheaper...\n",
      "There is no microphone on the headphones. Just the image of one\n",
      "These things are terrible, the sound is awful and the mic is fake (their is a picture of a microphone but it doesn't work).  100% garbage.\n",
      "Definitely not good for running. The earbuds kept sliding out of my ear and felt loosely fit overall. You would expect better from Apple. Of course the sound quality is good and it's great for non physical activities but that's true for a lot of earbuds out there.\n",
      "My original iPhone 6 earphones conked out. Initially, I bought two that were at a price too good to be true. They were cheaply made and not up to typical Apple-caliber. I replaced them with these and I am quite pleased. Beware of your purchases.\n",
      "Great. It works. I was nervous about all the bad reviews but now I have it works and I love it\n",
      "Great headphones!\n",
      "Not \"Genuine\"\n",
      "Got them on time and brand new. Unfortunately one of the cords was broken and so only one earbud worked. Also the one that did work was blown out so it rattles.\n",
      "Sound quality was weak. Price was good\n",
      "Junk!!! False advertising. NOT genuine\n",
      "I have bought many Apple EarPods from Amazon and just about 90% of them are FAKE. I just recently purchased this and i can confirm these are Legit - Straight from Apple. Great seller and would 10/10 recommend buying from this seller. Thank You.\n",
      "Got here quickly, sound is crispy and the headphones are in great shape.\n",
      "Great replacement for my Apple ear pods\n",
      "Good product and fast delivery!\n",
      "Perfect as described!! Excellent\n",
      "I'm very pleased with how fast I received my product.\n",
      "These are not Apple headphone and Amazon really needs to police these. They come in Apple package but are clearly not Apple. I've bought 2 packages thinking the first was a fluke. Sadly it wasn't.\n",
      "Sounded okay but broke quickly, the plastic casing of the earbuds fell apart in under a week.  These are NOT GENUINE APPLE products and should not be sold as such.\n",
      "definitely its not apple product\n",
      "Not working at all...\n",
      "Real deal not a knock off.\n",
      "Terrible. Bought two pair - both failed within one week.\n",
      "This is the 2nd pair I've ordered for my grandson and they keep breaking.\n",
      "very very fire (Apu's voice from Simpsons)\n",
      "Love them.\n",
      "good sound, durable and comfortable in your ears.\n",
      "They broke the first day I had them\n",
      "I purchased both sets of EarPods in orde to have an extra set as backup. After about 3-4 weeks the first set of EarPods started to malfunction. The microphone caused a lot of static, and the left earpiece stopped working. I then started using the \"backup\" pair. After 2-3 weeks, I experienced the same issues, this time the right earpiece stopped working. Though the price is enticing, I would not recommend this item at all.\n",
      "So good:)\n",
      "Authentic\n",
      "Genuine Apple product\n",
      "Lasted longer than my last pair, so they MAY be Apple. Maybe.\n",
      "Good price and quality!\n",
      "my g-son love the ear buds\n",
      "Warning: These are not misrepresented to be Apple official headphones. If you read from other buyers you will see that this is not true. Buyer beware.\n",
      "Awful, both pairs I bought broke within a month as the headphones just pop off the wire with a tiny pull.\n",
      "Volume with new iphone 5 not controllable with phones\n",
      "They are actually Apple brand headphones. I was worried they weren't after reading the reviews, but rest assured they are authentic.\n",
      "I bought these for my nephew's and they love them. They say the sound quality it's clear in they can still use it when they're talking on the phone.\n",
      "They scratch a lot and I'll have to fix the cord positioning\n",
      "Fell apart within one week! Although these earbuds look and feel real, they are nowhere near the quality of even good knockoffs. They fell apart within one week!\n",
      "Great!\n",
      "Feels really close to the Original OEM version. love these pods\n",
      "no comment\n",
      "I can't believe these were half the price of what I've seen them for.  Work Perfect.  Pleasantly surprised.\n",
      "very haoppy\n",
      "Great earphones for the price\n",
      "okay\n",
      "Works with iPhone\n",
      "FAKE, after 2 weeks of use the mic started to fail.\n",
      "Suck\n",
      "Really like the ear buds! I was stoked when I saw that they resembled the branded version :) and they were super affordable, definitely works for a college student during exam crunch times!\n",
      "These are not Apple EarPods!!! They are so cheap, the material and the sound quality. Horrible. Do not waste your money, you are better off buying the real thing in a store for $30. Waste if money!!!!\n",
      "I would give this a zero if I could, these are fake just like all the other reviews said. Mine broke within 2 weeks, one earphone just stopped working completely. So while they were only 10 bucks they suck. Do not buy just put that 10 dollars towards an actual set of real headphones\n",
      "As soon as I got them one of the ear drums blew out. I don't use them for music really. I got them to take work phone calls commuting home so its not like I am blasting music. I could definitely tell from the beginning they weren't as loud as the official Apple ones. I would not recommend.\n",
      "I have only used it for three months, the right earpods lost sound.\n",
      "These are clearly fake. They have stopped working in 12 hrs. Complete trash.\n",
      "Its the real deal. I was hesitant to buy this because its so much cheaper here than in other places.\n",
      "The headphones were not working just a few weeks after receiving them.\n",
      "Exactly like apple\n",
      "These cannot possibly be legitimate apple headphones. The right earpiece stopped working after about a week! Very underwhelming\n",
      "I bought these a while ago and they broke within a week or two of buying. I thought I was getting quality Apple earphones the entire time. Don't fall for it, just go buy the original earphones from Apple! These are very, very low quality!\n",
      "not apple band earbuds as advertised,cheap knock off!\n",
      "Fake earbuds the mic quality is utter garbage and the other party can't even hear you. These earbuds are terrible.\n",
      "They were hella fragile\n",
      "They keep popping and feel like they are electrocuting my ears. will return.\n",
      "My daughter love these.\n",
      "Great\n",
      "Came late. But there real iPhone head phones.\n",
      "Just got it, listen for 10 seconds, FAKE for no reason!\n",
      "Didn't work\n",
      "Great price and you can get next day shipping all around great deal\n",
      "Love these\n",
      "These claim to be OEM but I doubt it. 4 Stars for misleading the public ;)\n",
      "The headphones fit nicely and sound good, but they are not very durable. If you are looking for headphones that last long, these are not for you.\n",
      "After reluctantly buying these on Amazon after all of the negative reviews claiming that these are fake headphones, I found that these are actually genuine Apple EarPods. The EarPods look and feel like the ones that came with my phone and sound like it too (great sound and noticeable bass). They also have the small gray \"watermark\" with the Designed By Apple in California text and a serial number. For added security, the parts of the case these headphones came in is interchangeable with the one my EarPods came in with my phone, something that could easily be messed up with fake EarPods.\n",
      "They work great and they came as expected.\n",
      "i got an empty box...\n",
      "Genuine, good condition, great buy!\n",
      "Fake not Apple earpods\n",
      "Amazing quality! Equal to Apple headphones bought in store.\n",
      "gave it away\n",
      "At first I thought these headphones were not the real deal because of the price, but I was wrong! They sound great and they are authentic Apple EarPods. Glad I found a trusted seller!\n",
      "These are absolute garbage, fell apart after one use. Stay away\n",
      "loved it\n",
      "Great value, authentic Apple product (logo on case), great sound & work as expected. Included a personal note signed by four staff!  What more could you ask for!  Ordered late Friday, arrived early Monday! \n",
      "One earbud stopped working after a few weeks.  Sounds comes and goes.\n",
      "Perfect for morning exercise because it a sweat and water resistant earphones. I also like that it enhance the e bass sound of the phone which sounds very good.\n",
      "Returning it - very bad and heavy static on the line.\n",
      "My nephew he is happy with them\n",
      "This product appears to be a genuine product. My left earbud stopped working but I saw something that said that if you clean it's grill with a toothbrush it'll start working again and unbelievably I cleaned it and it works perfectly now. I am not rating this 5 stars because I had to do that.\n",
      "They were exactly what I expected them to be. They replaced the earbuds I'd ruined when I accidentally washed them and ruined the sound quality. I've since moved on to bluetooth earbuds but these definitely served their purpose when they were being used.\n",
      "Was very Leary to purchase these but I was pleasantly surprised. They are fantastic! I'm extremely pleased & will reorder these again when needed.\n",
      "Sound and buttons work just fine, but the mic is broken, so I guess I wasted my money buying another pair of earbuds without a mic :/\n",
      "They were fake ordered a replacement hopefully they are real.\n",
      "I bought a pair of these headphones off of ebay a couple of months ago but I lost the pair so I thought I'd buy them on Amazon due to the free 2 day shipping thing. Problem? The headphones worked fine for about a week and then the volume and play buttons stopped working. The headphones also came without the original apple packaging (the actual box) and instead just came in the typical plastic container.I'm guessing it could have been a knock off? Either way I pretty disappointed with the purchase.\n",
      "Yeah. They're fake. Effective, not the worst, but fake. Pretty upset.\n",
      "Advertised as Apple brand earpods, the response from the company claims they are authentic- they are most definitly NOT. Awful sound quality. Do NOT buy.\n",
      "Works great, sounds great !  Went and bought a few more sets too !\n",
      "The earpod works but remote and mic does not. Cheap plastic too.\n",
      "100% real (original from Apple) and costed a lot less than buying them in the Apple Store or Best Buy. I even got a second pair of them just in case I needed in the future.\n",
      "What I got wasn't Apple EarPods, there were a generic brand EarPods that were really bad in audio quality. Gonna stick to buying them in store to be safe for now on!\n",
      "I love the headphones!  I just got them and they sound great! They sound just like my previous earphones that came with my Apple iPhone 6 that stopped working because I accidentally jerked them apart. I don't know what all the bad reviews are about but I bought these straight from Amazon if that might make a difference.\n",
      "This is great! Good sound quaility.\n",
      "They may not be exact Apple EarPods but they can't get any closer. They sound just like the ones I lost, the only thing is they feel alittle cheaper made.\n",
      "good\n",
      "Sounds great. No complaints from me.\n",
      "Real apple Earpods - work great! Mic and remote work great.\n",
      "Don't buy them! They sound like crap and break in no time.\n",
      "Amazing...  Can't hear anyone around when turned all the way up. Good speaker and buttons works amazing.  Love buy buy buy\n",
      "works as expected\n",
      "Great Product\n",
      "Just perfect!\n",
      "I'm not convinced these are Apple EarPods. The mic doesn't work properly. Could be defective but I think I'll stick to purchasing Apple products from the Apple store from now on. Bit of a pain needing to repackage the product and print a label to return to Amazon all for a $11 item.\n",
      "Ok\n",
      "broke quickly\n",
      "STAY AWAY!!! the plastic box it came in was scratched up and COVERED in dust. I never opened it but I could see the headphones were also scratched up and covered in filth. I swear I see ear wax in the ear bud itself. Disgusting.\n",
      "Speakers went out in a week\n",
      "THIS IS LEGIT. Idk if they're authentic but they sound good.\n",
      "Worked great for the I Phone.\n",
      "I broke my headphones :( So I ordered these and they were perfect! They work amazing.\n",
      "When I first got them I played music and the left ear bud doesn't work wtf\n",
      "best earbuds I've ever used. actually stays in my ears when I go running - no other earbuds will stay in my ears. what more could I ask for? sound quality is good too.\n",
      "And so much cheaper than normal\n",
      "There are NOT legitimate apple headphones. They are knockoffs.  The sound quality is horrendous and the microphone is spotty. The microphone piece also came damaged on BOTH my original and defected items.\n",
      "Great product! These are the same as the headphones that come with Apple phones. I will definitely buy these again when we need new ones.\n",
      "Really good\n",
      "Identical to Apple except for a turquoise tint to the speaker itself inside the earbud. No problems though. Worked great. Fit my ears great.\n",
      "waiting to see how long it last in my hands\n",
      "Great sound quality!\n",
      "within four days of getting them, one of the speakers went out so only one side works.\n",
      "Love them\n",
      "In a house full of iPhone users my EarPods came up missing. These work great. I've ordered 4 sets at different times. I do not think these are the authentic EarPods but you won't notice much of a difference. One set felt like it was shocking me a bit as I constantly hear a crackling sound when I use them. Compared to 25 bucks at Apple Store these work good enough for me.\n",
      "Completely happy with my ear buds. They fit perfectly and is just as described. Will probably purchase another set. Great price, great product, fast shipping. Thanks!!\n",
      "It's the classic Apple earphones with the great bass tones. When I switch to any other earphones they sound tinny.\n",
      "If you're on the fence about this, then let me push you off the fence. Go the other way and don't bother getting this crap.\n",
      "Would not recommend whatsoever. Their sound was like echoed and after two days, the left earpiece came apart..absolutely horrible quality.\n",
      "These headphones can be described in one word: Solid. They probably aren't the best quality compared to Beats or other professional grade headphones, but for the price they can't be beat. They're sturdy and don't break easily, they have a good fit, and the sound quality is better than most other headphones that can be bought for the same price. The microphone piece is super convenient for music and for talking. Another thing that I think is important to mention is that they aren't outwardly loud. I personally like to listen to my music really loudly and it's nice that I know I'm not disturbing anyone around me. Overall I love them.\n",
      "I would give a 0 rating if I could. Ordered two pairs, both were obviously used (and had ear wax on them).\n",
      "I used this everyday and keeps the music in my ears with the ease of answering phone calls. Need earbuds then here they are\n",
      "There perfect and they work fine. I would've gave them 5 stars but I felt they could've came a little bit quicker but that's alright. They act just as the real ones.\n",
      "As expected, Seems Genuine.\n",
      "Do not compare to the quality of real Apple earbuds. What do you expect for the price was disappointed on quality.\n",
      "I used them 1 time and they instantly broke DONT BUY THIS\n",
      "THEY MIC BUTTONS DONT WORK\n",
      "It works ok but that not an apple product\n",
      "Terrible headphones. Feel very thin. Play pause answer hang up button does not work all of the time.\n",
      "Product is not oem it's made in China and poor quality , the ear piece fell off in one day\n",
      "Work great and prevents me from dragging headphones from place to place\n",
      "Left earbud stopped working after rwo days smh\n",
      "Factory quality, no complaints.\n",
      "I ordered these to replace the original earbuds that came with my iPhone 6 and I love them. I was a bit worried when I read all of the bad reviews saying these are fake, but I got real ones for sure. The sound quality is better than expected for the price and has good bass. If you are looking for a fantastic tempered glass screen protector for you iPhone 6, try ClearScreenz\n",
      "They broke after a hour.\n",
      "Fantastic\n",
      "These are not Apple ear pods! Shows an Apple box. Shoddy.\n",
      "They say these are OEM and authentic but my experience says they are fake. I bought two and both had static immediately and one ear louder than other. Also came apart in no time while the real Apple products last months. I do not know if the real Apple product has a logo but these do not. They look the same as real but performance says otherwise. Beware!\n",
      "very good!\n",
      "perfecto\n",
      "I am very disappointed. I lost my previous pair of Apple headphones which I happily used almost every single day for over a year. I decided to buy a replacement pair because I liked the Apple style headphones. However, after only 3 weeks of use the right earbud stopped working suddenly stopped working. I am very disappointed because my other pair lasted for a very long time, yet this new pair couldn't even last a month? I tested them on multiple devices and the problem is the same on all of them. It's a shame. I really liked my old pair.\n",
      "Good product, I enjoy the sound and delivery was quick. Would buy again.!\n",
      "They didn't look like apple headphones the inside was blue??  And it was visibly used prior there was scratches an even a hair on it\n",
      "Great... Apple!\n",
      "Best product ever!\n",
      "FAKE this is clearly not a ctual apple product. I bought it and cancelled right away when my friend got the same one and it didnt even work in his phone. It doesnt have that grippy feeling on the wire like all other apple ear buds have.\n",
      "ok but not the same as a pair of apple ear buds\n",
      "Very happy with the product. I have had them a good while now and they have performed well!\n",
      "The headphones microphone don't work half the time.\n",
      "i was scared cause i saw some reviews that said they were fake but i figured i should at least try cause they were so much cheaper, and they just arrived and they are definitely apple headphones! :)\n",
      "quailty\n",
      "Work great.\n",
      "These work just as well as the Apple brand earbuds, and look identical.  Same quality, lower price.  Can't beat that!\n",
      "What a ripe-off NOT genuine Apple.\n",
      "very good\n",
      "Sent me headphones on which one side didnt work\n",
      "These earbuds are probably rejects the sound is totally distorted I would not purchase these!\n",
      "I got 3 of this and all broke in no time flat. I wish Apple could produce a much better product.\n",
      "This product from the BuyItStore is NOT a genuine OEM Apple product.  The speakers rattle in the buds, the switches do not work properly and the wire is of sub-standard quality.  DO NOT BUY.\n",
      "Original ear buds work exactly as they should\n",
      "These have awful sound quality and are made of really cheap plastic\n",
      "Thought all was fine, but audio quality of the earphones sound real low and mic didnt work, function buttons worked, however not the mic.\n",
      "Works good but on occasion the volume control button doesn't work. They fit comfortably for my 14 year old\n",
      "I thought at first there we're going to be fake but when i got them they were real so thx\n",
      "good item! very useful.\n",
      "Perfect\n",
      "Maybe I got  a dud. Center button doesn't work. It's ok though, I got the wire caught on a doorknob today and instead of unplugging from the phone, the connector sheared and broke off inside the phone.  Awesome feature!  This product looked legit, but at that price it has to be a knock-off.\n",
      "Garbage\n",
      "This is *NOT* an Apple product.  What ridiculous loophole is allowing Amazon to sell it as such? It must be illegal and it is offensive and deceptive to customers. Please stop cheating us, Amazon. Take responsibility for selling this product and display whichever knock-off Chinese company is producing these things.\n",
      "Bought straight from Amazon, no third party and they're the real deal. They work great.\n",
      "These earphones are fake and sound nothing close to the original pair that came with my iPhone.\n",
      "Garbage. Microphone and remote do not work. Sounds terrible. DO NOT BUY THIS.\n",
      "Horrible!!!! I wasn't paying attention and accidentally bought these PLEASE DONT BUY THESE. The mic doesn't work and they are cheaper then the $7 ones at the gas station.\n",
      "I was a bit skeptical to buy it from Amazon because of the reviews calling it fake, etc.\n",
      "I got them about a month ago and both randomly broke. First one of them didn't charge...then the other one. The base that plugs into the wall works but not the actual cords. :/\n",
      "Worked great...for 5 days. The sound was great, but both of the earbuds snapped off less than a week after I received them. Not worth it.\n",
      "Just received my headphones after patiently waiting for them only to be disappointed. They look perfectly fine but when I plug the headphones into my phone it sounds as if it isn't plugged in all the way. I was skeptical about even buying headphones off Amazon since I know they're a knock off, definitely won't do it again.\n",
      "I love these.\n",
      "Purchased these earpods because my original ones got tangled with a chair and broke and I can't live without a pair so yes, had to replace the broken ones asap\n",
      "I ordered two sets. Within a matter of weeks one broke and the other only works in one ear. I'm not sure why these are substandard -- the description led me to believe I was purchasing brand new Apple product.\n",
      "Not a book suitable for children, basically teaching  them that is okay to bully other children.\n",
      "Do not buy!!! Works good for the first couple of days then it stops! I will never be buying from Amazon again!!!\n",
      "worst head phones I've ever bought. they barely worked, the volume button did not even work and knock off apple head phones. they broke in a week\n",
      "The product was an insult to the hardworking individuals who spent money on a worthless product that could not  last two days before these \"Apple Earphones\" were out of commission\n",
      "Right ear bud did not work. Mic and left seemed to work ok, but cord seemed stiff. Am returning product.  Package had apple logo and solid feel, but didn't work. So take from that what you will.\n",
      "At first i was concerned about the quality and authenticity of the product due to the mixed reviews but after receiving the earbuds it definitely appears to be real apple earbuds and they sound just like the ones I got with my iphone.\n",
      "Very good\n",
      "These are perfectly functional and the sound is great. The only issue I have is that I plugged them into my computer to listen to music and ever once and a while I got zapped in the ear!\n",
      "Can hear well however the earbuds seems to not be as comfortable and seems to slip out for some reason.  When on the phone you have to bring the mic close to your mouth for the person on the phone to hear you.\n",
      "good\n",
      "Good quality and rec'd quickly.  Mine work fine, however both my kids earbuds broke already.\n",
      "I just recently got mine today and yes it's same packaging and may seem like it has fake material or \"cheap\" but that's how Apple new headphones always feel. To tell if the headphones are indeed fake just look for \"designed by Apple not California\" on the bottom where the amp would be. It should be in grey writing , also in the fake ones they would have no writing in it.\n",
      "Apple's earbuds are the biggest joke! The quality is horrible, horrible and horrible. Nightmare product that will harm your ears and sanity. Let's wish this company go bankrupt in the nearest future. The faster the better. Tim Cook, kneel in front of Job's tombstone!\n",
      "FAKE!!! DO NOT BUY\n",
      "Worst product I've ever ordered.  Quality is less than awful.\n",
      "Already broken. My 18 year old son only used them for 2 weeks before one earbud stopped working.\n",
      "This was absolutely awful. Please, don't buy it.  Mine came dusty and dirty, which wasn't a problem at first as I cleaned it, and didn't really mind. I saw the Apple logo and it seemed to be legitimate. Mine had the R and L earbuds too. But now I noticed that the place where you click to lower or make the volume higher don't have the + and - sign- it just has the speaker sign. That part doesn't work either. Worst of all, only ONE of my earbuds actually works or produces sound, though not very well. It looks very cheaply made, doesn't go in the speaker all the way, and I almost broke my speaker because of it. PLEASE, PLEASE, I am begging you, DO NOT PURCHASE.\n",
      "Industry-traditional\n",
      "It's authentic\n",
      "THESE ARE NOT APPLE OEM. They look like it but aren't. Wires short out microphone brand new out of box only works half the time. The shell around the speaker on headphone came apart on day 2.\n",
      "They work great \n",
      "DO NOT BUY!!!! I had for THREE DAYS and then the left bud stopped working and you could hear a piece inside giggling around.\n",
      "I'm satisfied\n",
      "Only the right ear bud is audible after only a week of use.\n",
      "I don't know why I've seen so many bad reviews for this. I give it a 4/5 since they aren't the same as the original Apple EarPods but the quality is amazing and they're comfortable. I would definitely recommend this.\n",
      "As expected: my daughter uses it. Everything ok.\n",
      "Absolute trash.\n",
      "Thanks\n",
      "These definitely are not OEM. Don't buy!!!\n",
      "It's nice but when it came it was dusty and a bit dirty. So I sterilized it was rubbing alcohol (ALWAYS do that with these type of products, just in case )\n",
      "Exactly what it says. Nice pair.\n",
      "100% fake. Absolutely fake. Inline mic is horrible. Contacted Amazon & they want a return. Not even worth returning. No Apple logo on back of the case. Also, as you can see in the label on the back of the case, seller gives personal information\n",
      "Earphones came in good condition, but for some reason they Mute by themselves! My volume will randomly decrease by itself!\n",
      "Not a good deal they fell apart the 3rd time my son used them.\n",
      "Great product\n",
      "Great product.  I love it.  I would order again from the same supplier.  Thanks\n",
      "Came as promised\n",
      "I didn't like it because it's feak\n",
      "great product\n",
      "bought it for a friend\n",
      "very good\n",
      "Well let's start by saying that this are not original Apple EarPods because the material that is made of it feels cheap and the sound quality it's not the same as the apple original EarPods TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED\n",
      "Not real iPhone headphones.  Bought this on February 21st and now it is March 29th and one earbud is out and since it's right after the 30 days I can't return it. Thanks Amazon.\n",
      "Junk.  NOT an Apple product.  I want my money back too.\n",
      "They felt flimsy and inauthentic when they arrived.  It's been 3 weeks and they're falling apart.  I don't think these are actual Apple EarPods.  Don't recommend.\n",
      "Good quality product.\n",
      "i bought these in October, and it is now march, and they are already broken. very unhappy with these headphones.\n",
      "Fake crap. Bought 4 pair because it I'm always losing them. The earbuds fall apart within days, usually the left one. Worthless.\n",
      "Absolutely terrible. I've had these barely a week and the mic doesn't work with them.\n",
      "I will always repurchase these, even though I'm always losing them while traveling, etc. These are the most comfortable earpods ever and I use the microphone constantly with facetime. Very high quality.\n",
      "they are real...no fake.\n",
      "They are great ! Just cheaper than the original price which is always good !\n",
      "I feel like they're gonna break soon\n",
      "Everything else worked except the volume down button and one of the headphones has a lower volume than the other\n",
      "Good, but not as good as expected.\n",
      "I bought 3 or 4 of these. They seem to stop working properly after a couple of months. It happened with two of them already. Will not repurchase.\n",
      "BUSTED after just 3 months of use. The metal adapter that plugs into the phone broke off inside of my phone, and I had to dig out the remaining piece with pliers. Customer service is giving me the runaround on the warranty, although the warranty claims this item is covered for a full year.\n",
      "Right earbud doesn't work that well.\n",
      "The sound is terrible terrible terrible! And the controls don't always work. Didn't realize it was used, but must be.\n",
      "Work great! Sound quality excellent.\n",
      "Sound quality wasn't horrible, but after wearing these headsets for a while I often feel like I'm still wearing the headphones when I don't for about an hour. Something is wrong with the plastic that these knockoffs are using.\n",
      "5,900 other reviewers couldn't be wrong. Even after owning a dozen other in-ear headphones I keep coming back to Apple. The combination of sound quality, ease of use, volume and track controls, and price make these the best headphones. The only reason I gave these 4 is because they are known for failing after a while. Fingers crossed.\n",
      "Regular headphones, get what you paid for.\n",
      "Great headphones but nothing special, They sound fine and are comfortable for a time. The shape fits easier than most and it is nice that it doesnt go completely into the ear. They do start to hurt a little after a bit of time and they are a bit on the pricey side if not buying from amazon or somewhere with a discount but if you are looking for just a set of headphone and last and you dont have to think to hard about these are the pair.\n",
      "Just a regular pair of headphones\n",
      "The left side is louder than the right side which is driving me crazy. I'm never buying another one of these again. It worked fine for a couple of weeks but then I noticed that the left pod was A LOT louder than the right, now I have to choose which ear I want to listen through.\n",
      "I took them out of the box and they broke when I pulled them out of my ear after the first phone call. Amazon should pull this item and NOT allow it to be sold. These are CRAP!\n",
      "Headphones didn't work in the right ear. I believe these are fake earphones.\n",
      "Great headphones for a great price. Same ones on sale at Best Buy for $29.\n",
      "Mic and ear buds work fine so far.\n",
      "The headphones were used.\n",
      "I had the earphones directly from Apple before this and I honestly don't notice a difference. They work great, and I've had them for awhile now.\n",
      "Perfect\n",
      "Good works perfect\n",
      "Real authentic\n",
      "Cheap knock offs, don't buy these. I bought three pairs and all them were horribly shoddy in both construction and sound quality.\n",
      "Cheap Brand\n",
      "Sound great :) but not made for everyone's ears\n",
      "1. These are definitely knockoffs\n",
      "Good quality\n",
      "the mic and volume buttons didn't even work. whack. dont buy!\n",
      "I bought some cheap Apple headphone for $5 and u get what u pay for because the left ear was blown out right out the package. On a lighter note, I bought these and they are so much better!!! Totally satisfied and I'm actually thinking about stomping out the $5 pair literally.\n",
      "Basically, these are terrible. I had them about a week before the wire coating peeled away at the plug, exposing wires.\n",
      "The left earbud doesn't work\n",
      "v satisfied\n",
      "Garbage\n",
      "the item broke after one week of light use\n",
      "great condition\n",
      "Earphones broke the very next day after using them\n",
      "Not sure if these are actual apple headphones but they are good quality.\n",
      "Only one side worked right out the package\n",
      "I am a big guy and the pods simply pky wont stay in my ear.  Otherwise fantastic product.\n",
      "Didn't appear to be Genuine apple product.  Had a lot of technical issues with the earpods...a lot of fuzz sound.\n",
      "Great product. Recommend\n",
      "AWESOME POSSUM!! Received these in mail faster than expected and they work FANTASTIC!! Ordered a second pair!!\n",
      "Great Sound quality, acquired on time, and still working. These headphones are a perfect gift for anyone in need of them, they have great bass especially when you set your phone's music setting to bass boost. Great heaphones over all and very durable. Great Buy!\n",
      "Break WAY too easily\n",
      "WORKS WELL\n",
      "Cheap knockoff. Lasted about 3 days.\n",
      "I love my new earphones\n",
      "This item is not an Apple product. It's a cheap nock off and the quality is absolutely terrible. Don't buy these.\n",
      "I received the earbuds today, they are definitely not OEM. The quality is not good, the buttons are hard to push. The cords are very thin. The plastic case that they came in was cracked.  They will definitely be returned. I only gave one star because you cannot leave a review otherwise. Very disappointed.  Thought these were supposed to be new, but they had been opened and repackaged.  Someone else probably returned.\n",
      "I was nervous before i get this.\n",
      "Works just as well as the pair of Apple earbuds that came with my iPod, which were chewed up by my cat. That's all I wanted or could hope for.\n",
      "Left ear bud buzzs with all bass notes after a week.\n",
      "good\n",
      "True apple made earned at a fantastic price, very happy with my purchase\n",
      "Best headphones ever\n",
      "Fit well into ear holes, comfortable and sleek. Mic on cord is essential.\n",
      "Great\n",
      "I bought two of these and they both have terrible sound quality.  I doubt this is a real Apple product.\n",
      "Not authentic\n",
      "Heard too much wind while riding my bike, other than that they fit nice and sounded great\n",
      "They were pretty decent\n",
      "Remote stopped working less than a week after purchase\n",
      "BEWARE: these are NOT an Apple product.\n",
      "Great earphones!!\n",
      "Standard for earpods, tends to have slightly warmer and better midrange than the knock-offs. But just slighttly.\n",
      "They are not real apple earpods. They break much easier but if you take great care of them you can have them for a few months\n",
      "THIS IS A FAKE item. Avoid\n",
      "Jack was broken when ear pods arrived\n",
      "Amazing!\n",
      "good\n",
      "DON'T BUY. IT'S A FAKE. THEY BROKE IN ONE MONTH\n",
      "the right ear just stopped working and I got this less than a month!\n",
      "Only one of the earphones works.\n",
      "Just got these today to replace other headphones that I had purchased through Amazon, the Xcords(TM) Wired Headset Earphones Earbuds Headphones with Mic and Volume Control, which were terrible. I've been listening to music for a few hours while at work and have also made a few phone calls. They seem to be great! Definitely can hear well, the volume is nice & loud, and there's no static on the line at all.\n",
      "Easy transaction. The item was exactly as expected. Excited to replace my old ones with these\n",
      "one ear bud was broke\n",
      "I seem to buy these regularly because I have cats who ignore their toys (that are cheap) to chew on my earbuds (which are not cheap). I decided that I've given Apple enough of my money for replacements, so I ordered here. Identical and works. I can't say anything on longevity because none have lasted more than a month or so due to cat chewage. But for the time being, it works!\n",
      "Worked great, me and the homie white birch were listening to our music having a great time.  Sadly I fell down some stairs and they broke.  Don't worry the stairs were fine.\n",
      "Its a genuine Apple product as best as I can tell.  Works as expected.\n",
      "The mic, turned to the left and people could not hear me on a call. I did not like it\n",
      "just ok\n",
      "Both units delivered had one side that did not function on first use.\n",
      "These are exactly what I expected and packaged well. I was able to get them for $11 on a warehouse deal and I couldn't figure out why they were \"warehouse\" Everything was in original packaging and they work great.\n",
      "Perfect\n",
      "It's good\n",
      "Sound great!\n",
      "works as expected\n",
      "broke after 2 weeks. do not buy\n",
      "GREAT\n",
      "Good\n",
      "Bad quality, worked for two weeks.\n",
      "I like these I buy a lot of in ear but always end up buying these back cause they sound awesome & they cancel out a lot more that you think so if you need headphones that play music good & loud that's are your buy just was they canceled out more tho\n",
      "They appear to be the real apple ear pods and not the knock offs, which is  relief over some of the reviews. Feel great and work well. Great price too.\n",
      "i don't like the sound quality of ear pods .totally fake it is not original apple ear pods.\n",
      "Only one earbud worked.\n",
      "Right out of the box the \"stable kickstand\" broke.\n",
      "It was a good product and thank you\n",
      "Great for your iPod or iPad.\n",
      "great price and the product is quality\n",
      "i don't think this is from apple both the head phone are for your left ear and the quality was horrible never buy from them\n",
      "Exactly what I ordered which is rare with these items.\n",
      "Just like the ones that come with the iPhone!\n",
      "great deal! sounds great!\n",
      "Good deep bass sound and clarity.\n",
      "Just did a side by side comparison with these EarPods and the ones that came with my iphone. They are exactly the same. No conspiracy here. Buy with confidence. Don't believe everything you read.\n",
      "They broke before being used the first time\n",
      "They are genuine, and are real apple!\n",
      "There was not any remote. Moreover, the volume control was not working. Hence, I returned the product\n",
      "Earphones work (with some static), but microphone do not..\n",
      "Very good\n",
      "Great purchase. Great seller.\n",
      "Good earplugs for cheap. Worth it for the price\n",
      "The EarPods are good for a very cheap price. Very loud also I would recommend buying\n",
      "Would not recommend. These broke within the first week and handled with decent care. My last pair of apple headphones lasted 3 years. Disappointed in the quality\n",
      "The mic does not work properly, no one on the other end of the phone can hear me. The sound quality sucks, everything sounds low. I would not recommend these.\n",
      "The ear buds fell apart in less than 2 weeks.....:(\n",
      "it is a fake apple headphone\n",
      "They came just fine\n",
      "love these\n",
      "These are not REAL, they are FAKE and sound completely different than genuine Apple earbuds. DO NOT BUY THESE.\n",
      "They work great!\n",
      "Very good\n",
      "The Apple Earpods fit nicely but are not as comfortable as the Scosche sportCLIPS. Sound is very good.\n",
      "Sound is amazing!  Ear comfort, not so much.  They are hard not squishy so they can create sore spots in ears if you fall asleep or they just don't fit your ear correctly.\n",
      "Its hurt your left ear,that design is horrible,I cant use it anymore...\n",
      "Don't feel like the Earpods that came with my phone at all. Originals are have way more rubbery feel and are much softer. And the sound quality is TERRIBLE!!!\n",
      "These are my favorite earbuds. The speaker always has good clarity, and they fit perfect in my ears.\n",
      "Super great, worked for me! Would recommend if you needed something to get you by, I might just get another!\n",
      "I paid for a new item and received a poorly repackaged used one.\n",
      "Not real oem headphones,you can tell because there is no serial number on it\n",
      "Second time ordering these; they work beautifully and last forever. Honestly wouldn't buy any other brand.\n",
      "NOT MADE BY APPLE. GENERIC CRAP. Sound quality is poor, construction poor. save your money and search somewhere else. The Headphone jack bent inside the phone within 3 days.\n",
      "I like them.\n",
      "Not sure if they are genuine or not, but they definitely feel and sound like it!\n",
      "Great product and seller!\n",
      "The ear pods were two left sides no right side at all.\n",
      "Remote and mic broke within the first hour. Great.\n",
      "Quality apple earbuds\n",
      "Item is not real headphones. says it is sold by apple but I got headphones that look fake and feel fake. volume is not even between two earbuds. The volume changer on the headphones does not work too.\n",
      "Fake. Returned mine the day it came\n",
      "Love them\n",
      "Left ear side does not work want refund.\n",

      "T'was a bright and sunny day, and Ke$ha had just come out with her new album, and boy was I jamming. I listened nonstop for a solid 2 months I'd say. Well, the other day my parents invited me to eat with them at a Mexican restaurant, and I got really excited and said yes. I was so hungry, I could have eaten a whole chalupa. When our waitress, Heather, brought us the chips and salsa, I took a huge bite, but it was so right my nose turned bright red and began to bleed profusely. I panicked, and my mom and dad were screaming. I used my provided napkin, but that was gone in a heartbeat. Heather even gave me lemon-scented wipe, but all that did was make the blood smell like lemons. Then, it hit me. I knew what I had to do. I grabbed my Apple earpods (with remote and mic) and stuck the L in my left nostril, and the R in my right nostril and slammed my head back. Immediately, the bleeding stopped, and everyone cheered. Heather asked me to marry her, because she found my method so sexy. So I could say, that it is because of these overpriced Apple earpods that I have a wife, and two kids (oranjelo and limonjelo). I have to listen to Ke$ha through my speakers, but it was all worth it because of where I am at now in my life. Also, I got a free chalupa.\n",
      "Great pair of headphones got what I paid for\n",
      "Nice music sound, but doesn't work for web meetings.\n",
      "They were exactly what I wanted.\n",
      "Great earphones\n",
      "Works perfectly fine\n",
      "These sound almost as good as my $70 SteelSeries Siberia v3's!\n",
      "not really good quality compare to the real one that i bought in apple store\n",
      "These are fake and said to be by 'Apple' but that is not true and is false advertising. I could tell they were fake from the second i opened them. They feel cheap and don't sound even close to the Apple ones.\n",
      "Work great! No issues, speedy delivery.\n",
      "great\n",
      "Horrible sound\n",
      "Not the real deal.\n",
      "Good Quality\n",
      "Works great\n",
      "The EarPods doesn't seem to be Apple original, when I block the two poresthe sound should be different, but it was same. Now the right one doesn't work…\n",
      "Best earbuds!\n",
      "Kids seem to enjoy these and came on time\n",
      "The quality of the ear buds were just horrible, they got very staticky when the wire would barely move. Not happy with the ear buds I received\n",
      "very poorly made. I didn't even use it and it broke apart. I tried to send it back, but it just wasn't worth the effort. so disappointed\n",
      "I love them\n",
      "Great\n",
      "Not gonna give 5 beacause you know some fake there reviews but im a real person and these aren't fake if there real the must have an apple logo on the back of the box and the rubber must be soft not like a plastic feel  and make sure it doesn't sound like a radio or static those are man fakkeeeeee. Peace :) Jose out\n",
      "These are not real, genuine Apple earbuds. Buyer beware!\n",
      "I don't know why it seems like the voice of the right one is bigger than the left one!?\n",
      "These headphones are cheaply made, the headphone jack is really finicky and causes the audio to cut out or become stacticy, normally I love these headphones but lately they've been utter trash\n",
      "What can I say.....they are Apple ear phones. They work perfect!\n",
      "....Alles richtig gut (German).....\n",
      "Definitely not Apple made, quality and sound does not hold up!\n",
      "I recived a damaged product ...I want my money back or another good product\n",
      "Wish I'd read the reviews before purchasing. These looked like legit Apple ear buds, but the minute I used them I  noticed the sound quality was horrible. I was purchasing to replace my original ear buds that came with my iPhone as the cord was getting touchy. I compared the sound quality between the old and the new and the new didn't even come close. Amazon has issued me a return authorization and I will be shipping them back tomorrow.\n",
      "These were fake and the volume control didn't work\n",
      "eh\n",
      "packaging and making seems the same but really:\n",
      "They are not real. They stop eorking in 3 days. Waste of money\n",
      "These are not actual iPhone Earbuds. They look the same, but the apple logo is not on the case, and they are made much cheaper. The wire is super thin and cheap looking with a sound quality to match. I wouldn't recommend buying these unless you want a really cheap pair that you would be ok with loosing.\n",
      "This product has a faulty connection. It does not have the same weight or feel as a Genuine Apple Headset does.\n",
      "mic volume buttons diddnt work. Broke in 2 weeks. Not very happy with these.good sound while they lasted though. May not be apple headphones but came in the apple case and look like apple headphones\n",
      "They came about 2 days earlier than expected. I'm just so glad that I could find ones cheaper than they originally are in stores! (About $30) They work perfectly.\n",
      "worked\n",
      "Item was here promptly. No problems at all.  Item was as described.\n",
      "Not sure if it's original from Apple.  After three months stopped working…\n",
      "Matched Descrition\n",
      "It works well. I got it at good price. I think it is genuine.\n",
      "Only 4 stars because I use android\n",
      "Good.\n",
      "Great quality\n",
      "Yesssssss so glad these are exactly as described\n",
      "I was in need of new Apple earphones. I'm just glad I received it wayyyy early than expected. Plus it's high quality sound too, I love it :)\n",
      "good product but the earphones themselves irritated my ear. Mostly likely just the way my ears are shaped or not use to having something in them often. They lasted a long time. Ide recommend these.\n",
      "Just like my last pair i loved these EarPods. These are in no doubt the best sounding and most durable headphones i have ever used and owned ever. Would highly recommend for you to buy. IF you have the money get some better sounding pairs but for a cheap price these Earpods are godly.\n",
      "Not the best but it's gud\n",
      "These feel so fake and cheap but I guess they still work as intended. Feels like cheap plastic.\n",
      "Great sound and excellent value.\n",
      "The right earbud stopped playing sound in under 3 weeks and the left bud went out within the net week.\n",
      "Love these.\n",
      "Sound quality is good and I really enjoy the fit. The only problem with these is that I find they are somewhat fragile and usually give out after a couple months of use.\n",
      "Unique fit - stays in the ear reasonably well with good sound quality. A good value\n",
      "Very comfortable in your ears.\n",
      "The sound on these is really bad, like REALLY REALLY BAD, the remote part fell apart within 5 minutes. The bass on these is really loud to the point where it drowns out everything else and everything sounds mono through them instead of stereo even though my iPod is set to stereo sound and not mono\n",
      "I just bought this and my right one isnt working anymore\n",
      "Love these\n",
      "Works well, only complaint is that the cord is not super long... but work fine if your hooked up to your cellphone nearby, but not so much if you're connected to a gym treadmill.\n",
      "Just like apple but cheaper then buying at apple\n",
      "this is what you get when you buy the phone...\n",
      "They broke the first week I had them.\n",
      "It's been a little over a month of owning these and the sound in the left ear is 50% gone. Now I have to buy another pair of earbuds. I rated these at three stars because the pair I received when I bought my new iPhone worked well until my dad (accidentally) ran them over with his car. These were meant to be a replacement pair, but now I have to replace the replacements.\n",
      "I take care of my personal items & I have bought EarPods before, these were the worst. You can tell that these EarPods were used & repackaged. On the EarPods, you can see scratches from previous use. The wire is also sensitive. If I lightly move the cord, I get a static or fuzzy sound.\n",
      "Works, cheaper than in store.\n",
      "Doubt these are genuine. They broke the first day so returning them. The packing did not have Apple embossed on it like the packing that comes with phones.  one on the left is the one I received with this order one on right is what comes with phone.  Very disappointed that Amazon allows this to happen.\n",
      "These are fake knockoff. The user listed them as \"sold by Apple\" which is false\n",
      "same as apples earpods would recommend to buy them\n",
      "I would hav gave them 5 stars but shortly after i got them the left earphone went out.\n",
      "Good quality and cheap something that other company's can't beat\n",
      "Perfect sound for not audiophiles =) Design is so ordinary, but classic\n",
      "Exactly what I wanted!\n",
      "it is not a shure but make a great job for the price\n",
      "dont buy this...material feels cheap\n",
      "They're the same Apple earphones, my only gripe is that the clicker in the mic does not always pause my music.\n",
      "100% Apple EarPods at a really good price\n",
      "Product exactly as expected\n",
      "great poduct.\n",
      "Nice :D\n",
      "Headphones work fabulously, as they should. I'd definitely by them again when I need them.\n",
      "old apple headphones had wire damage, which was causing problems w/ phone. bought new ones for cheap. sound way better, problems w/ pandora gone.\n",
      "Perfect! Will order again thanks\n",
      "My headphones broke after no longer than a month.\n",
      "Mic an volume buttons didn't work but everything sounded good\n",
      "My daughter is very pleased with her new EarPods.  Good price.\n",
      "Works great\n",
      "authentic apple earpods\n",
      "Awesome headphones for the price. Each pair lasts me at least 6 months.\n",
      "Excellent product, Good price!!!\n",
      "Started shorting out first time I used them\n",
      "Amazing.\n",
      "These are the real thing! I bought them 3 months ago and they are still working well!\n",
      "I would give 0 stars but its not an option. I should have listened to the reviews. They came with a cracked earbud which doesn't work.....and the worst part - they had ear wax dried inside of them!!!!!\n",
      "Great earbuds, love the volume control on the cord.  Comfortable fit.  I am able to comfortably use at night and have no problem sleeping with them in.\n",
      "As always A1 qualify from an Apple product and Amazon!!\n",
      "The product worked perfectly. I actually dropped my phone and it landed directly on the part of the plug that goes into my phone and the piece broke apart. I had to use tweezers to get the plug out of my phone. It was my fault but i'm not sure if it should have broke that easily.\n",
      "Good\n",
      "Works good .\n",
      "apple products the best\n",
      "Quality product!\n",
      "Perfect\n",
      "Nothing wrong with them; undamaged and work perfectly\n",
      "Awesome EarPods!!\n",
      "Working good\n",
      "Very happy, item is exactly as described\n",
      "My mother-in-law liked them better than originals\n",
      "Great transaction!  Great product!\n",
      "I am pleased to see that the earbuds are working great and the sound is fantastic. I'm so glad I ordered these\n",
      "I bought a spare pair of apple ear buds after buying some cheap ones from the drug store.  Apple buds fit my ears better and the sound is great.  Trying to \"recycle\" the ones I hated.\n",
      "Got exactly what I needed even in the apple casing! And shipping was super fast!\n",
      "Sound quality is bad and low..\n",
      "Shipping was fast and everything about the earpods work fine except for the volume control on the remote. The volume does not decrease when (–) is hit as it pauses instead. Increasing the volume, however, works fine.\n",
      "Complete rubbish!! I bought these thinking they are the real deal! NOPE! The right side (the side with the mic) doesn't work. The sound quality of the left sounded like the speaker was busted. The rubber surrounding the wires are cheap material. Utterly disappointed. Im just going to buy them at the Apple Store.\n",
      "Working well for me. No complaints in shipping or product. Will buy again if need to. \n",
      "Did not last long :(  always had pretty good luck with Apple products this one broke with-in 1 week.\n",
      "For a company with so much research power and manufacturing capability you'd think all of their products would be perfect. In actuality, though, Apple is almost perfect. They do what is absolutely necessary (usable products that don't break instantly) and then they add a few bells and whistles. These earbuds are just that case. They work fine, sound OK, and it's nice that it has a volume adjuster and built-in mic.\n",
      "The work.\n",
      "They are nice. I am not a ear phone person, but I do recommend these.\n",
      "Great head phones, came in on time, great packaging and great quality. Will use it again\n",
      "Apple earphones are the best !!!\n",
      "Bought for my son and he said the quality is good.\n",
      "Standard Apple earbuds, but they are hard to beat.... still going strong, great quality sound for the price!\n",
      "Good as usual!\n",
      "highly not recommendreally bad terrible thingthrow away already and got a new one from Apply\n",
      "They work perfectly.  Who could ask for more?\n",
      "All around solid earbuds. Exactly what I was looking for at much cheaper than in-store.\n",
      "I really like it....\n",
      "Quality is horrible. Also, they are not genuine. They're some knock offs. Remote mic doesn't work.\n",
      "Works great!\n",
      "FAKE! do not buy it\n",
      "Sound quality is good but they hurt my ears.\n",
      "Bought better quality at dollae store. Headphones dont work.\n",
      "The third pair I bought from Amazon and just like the rest it broke within a week. The volume button literally just fell off as I was walking. It is not Apple certified. Just go to apple and pay for the real thing\n",
      "These actually work guys. Don't be discouraged, it works and they are authentic. Beats paying 30 bucks at a Best Buy, that's for sure.\n",
      "My product is stained with something brown on the mic. and part of the cord is ripped. You get what you pay for.\n",
      "You can't hear anything on the right side of my earphones but you can hear on the left. I was wondering if I can just get another pair or just get my money back??\n",
      "There was ear wax I my \"NEW\" earbuds!!!\n",
      "No way this is oem\n",
      "The anatomical design is greta!\n",
      "I am very satisfied with my purchase from seller IBD Electonics if you want real authentic Apple earpods choose IBD Electronics as your seller.\n",
      "ONE OF THE BUDS DIDNT WORK WTF\n",
      "I bought these a year ago and was pretty broke. I looked at a bunch of different reviews and still wasn't 100% confident after i bought these. Apple doesn't need my help with advertising, but i wanted to leave a review for the next person like me who's looking for a good pair of headphones. The sound quality is great. I guess i have normal-sized ears because they don't get uncomfortable. I've slept with them in a couple times. They've gone through the washer and dryer, and also survived a night in the rain. I couldn't happier because everything still works, and i love the mic feature. This is a great deal.\n",
      "I should have listened to the comments I read - Bought 3, 1st one stopped working after 2 weeks, 2nd one the right earbud did not work - on number 3\n",
      "The wires break really easily\n",
      "Dependable and affordable. It produces clear and superb sound.\n",
      "A good product\n",
      "Don't buy they're fake\n",
      "Well the sound is great, but you have to press hard for the pause button. The protector was cracked when i open the package. Deliver on time. Overall, for me its good enough\n",
      "Good products. Took well care of it and lasted for several months.\n",
      "First, these are definitely genuine Apple ear pods. I bought these directly from Amazon and they were genuine so perhaps the ones that were not genuine came from elsewhere. I dropped my phone while running on the treadmill and my original ear pods got sucked in and shredded so I ordered these and they're exactly the same. I've been using them for about a month and a half and the cord hasn't started to wear or fray at all. The sound is the same as the original ear pods. Mind these are ear buds so if you're looking for perfect sound, you're barking up the wrong tree but for working out, walking to work or class, riding the train/bus, and general on the go listening, these will do the job.\n",
      "Apple rocks my world. These are well engineered.\n",
      "good\n",
      "Not Apple. Super Crappy\n",
      "They work great I hope they continue to work great and last a long time\n",
      "Not official.\n",
      "Horrible\n",
      "Not good at all..\n",
      "Would not buy again they don't fit my ears nor does the sound bar work to turn up the volume without clipping it.\n",
      "Unless you prefer your music to sound like it is amplified by a soda can, do not buy these. This product is poorly made. These are not made by Apple. The plastic feels different than Apple headphones. I don't believe these will last long.\n",
      "Not legitimate Apple ear buds.  Just bought a iPod and their ear buds sound amazing.  These knock-offs sound TERRIBLE!  Very tinny and the music sounds distorted.  I'm sending mine back.\n",
      "Defiantly Genuine and the real deal Apple earbuds. Great sound with amazing microphone quality. My only complaint is they do leave your ears sore after hours of wear in one day. (maybe it's just me.)\n",
      "Good deal will use again\n",
      "I was super excited about recieving my new EarPods. They looked & worked great for the first week! And then by week two the left ear stopped working. I was really sad because I loved my new EarPods.... Oh well...\n",
      "First off, these are NOT Apple EarPods.  They look a lot like them, but the sound and build quality are not up to par. My left earpod came apart on day two.  I can snap it back together, but it falls apart at least once daily.  While the sound quality does not match the authentic Apple product. The sound is acceptable.  Maybe if they were better built and didn't claim to be an Apple product, I would give then higher rating, but sadly, none of that is the case.\n",
      "This is fake earphones. Does not have a good quality. And also the speaker split open up the first time I open the box...\n",
      "As good as the OEM\n",
      "You get what you pay for.  Volume is satisfactory and there absolutely no base :(\n",
      "Way too thin\n",
      "Had one before!. Nice but a little too frail. Great sound\n",
      "The real deal!!!! Bought these for myself and my daughter took over on them since her beats broke.  Need to get another pair.\n",
      "Quality as expected. Not much for noise reduction though.\n",
      "AWFUL - HORRIBLE - Never seen any worse earbuds.  Do not be fooled - waste of money!!!!!!!\n",
      "great\n",
      "The mic and volume control was broken and one of the ear buds made a weird noise \n",
      "Compared to the headphones I received when I purchased my phone, these were much cheaper. They worked fine for 2 months and then the right headphone stopped working, and then a week later, the left one stopped working too.\n",
      "Authentic, great quality. Really recommend it.\n",
      "best quality ones to use with ur iphone is the original\n",
      "I was very disappointed with the Apple EarPods...the remote did not work.  I returned the item.\n",
      "Good price for good quality EarPods.\n",
      "best earphones for the price.\n",
      "Still best ear buds to this day, I can easily multi-task/call in them unlike others. Easy to use.\n",
      "Very good\n",
      "The headphones and microphone worked on my old LG Volt but only the headphones worked on my husband's old Samsung Galaxy S3, we now have new phones and the tables are turned: my new LG Stylo will only recognize it as a headphone device (no microphone use available) and his new Samsung Galaxy Prime allows both headphones and microphone use. I am allergic to silicone headphones and silicone-free headphones with microphone are hard to come by, especially a pair that will not fall out, so material and fit were great! The case is helpful to keep the wire from getting tangled or bent and the audio pieces from getting damaged; when not kept in the case one of the headphones split open easily.\n",
      "Perfect! \n",
      "Done\n",
      "note : the product i have is the OFFICIAL APPLE PRODUCT  (not those fake ones  being sold by some of the third party sellers ) , so my review only apply to the official ones.\n",
      "not loud . one earphone went out very fast .\n",
      "Great-Thanks!\n",
      "Definitely are not made actually by apple. The piece on the wire to control volume and talk into does not work.\n",
      "For the price, great. Just like original.\n",
      "Solid.\n",
      "Seller: IBD Electronics\n",
      "Very good product with good price!\n",
      "Works as advertised.  Audio and functionality as expected\n",
      "Grate shipping and grate working head phones!!\n",
      "Worried that these weren't original but I gave it a shot and bought them. I can tell you that they are 100% authentic Apple EarPods .\n",
      "It's not the original one, the quality is much lower, specially its Mic!\n",
      "if buy though amazon.com, then it good. 100% apple. other don't know ..\n",
      "Ordered 2 pair and neither volume control work on either. Very disappointing. I don't believe these are genuine apple products and this is false advertising.\n",
      "They had a short in them and never worked. I did get a quick refund with no problem.\n",
      "Nice for the price. Daughter loves them.\n",
      "Needed a replacement pair after I washed my original pair in the washing machine. You can never go wrong with EarPods, they have a consistent and also a pretty high sound quality considering the price. They came in super quick too.\n",
      "These are terrible. Used once, and only one muffled ear bud worked (sort of).  Do not buy these. Ugh.\n",
      "It is not original at alllll. at least mine. broke after 5 days\n",
      "Those were really bad. Don't recommend them at all. Save yourself the trouble and buy the original or some other trusted brand. Really disappointed because I was looking forward to using them, but as soon as they arrived and tried them for a week, it was clear that its a cheap product. So I just went a head and ordered from Apple.\n",
      "After reading the many scary reviews on this product, I still decided to purchase it. When I received this item it was exactly as described. Works perfectly, constructed very well and it is an authentic Apple product and it came in the clear case packaging you find when you purchase the latest new IPHONE. When I purchase something on Amazon and it states Original item, that is EXACTLY what I receive.\n",
      "Nice\n",
      "They were great at first then the left ear bud started to have problems so i got mad and hit the left one as hard as i could on my desk then it started to work again.\n",
      "Work great\n",
      "Very good\n",
      "Do not buy this product. Fake\n",
      "Works great!\n",
      "good\n",
      "Just as described.\n",
      "These are not Apple headphones. They are lower quality and broke within one month. Sound quality is fine, but durability is not.\n",
      "Great sound. Easy to place, and they stay put.\n",
      "Bad, dirty, awfull packaging\n",
      "Very low quality. Not real thing.\n",
      "Sound is clear. I would recommend it.\n",
      "Excellent!!!!\n",
      "The sound was somewhat muffled, as if I was listening through a toilet paper roll. But not a cool toilet paper roll, like the ones with colored cellophane that let's you see the world through a whole new perspective. Anyway, not my worst purchase, thanks to that man with those magic beans...\n",
      "Original Apple accessory. Great buy\n",
      "Great headphones, original apple head pods, about $5 cheaper than in store.\n",
      "These are great headphones, and I have ordered quite a few pairs.  Yes, they do stop working eventually... but I use them daily for my workout and usually have to replace them about once per year.  Just make sure you pick the ones that are \"sold and fulfilled by Amazon.com\" as - based on other reviewers - that's what I have always done and I have never had a problem with them.\n",
      "Works fine\n",
      "I already did a review on the ear buds.\n",
      "Arrived as a Christmas present for our daughter. Of course she didn't open them until the 30 day return window was expired. head phone wires were cut and metal plug was broken off. Complete garbage. If this company was a person I would punch them in their face and talk trash about their mom.\n",
      "received it damaged\n",
      "I didn't purchase these from Amazon, it just came with my phone. I figured they were an improvement from the old headphones. They sort of are because the speaker in the headphones project directly inside your ear. That's the only improvement.\n",
      "To be clear, I bought them from the company BREED. They're not real. I compared them to my apple headphones (that I know are real since I bought them at the store) and the design of them and simple feel of the headphones make it obvious that they're fake. Either way though, they're still pretty good. I've paid $5 on cheap apple ripoffs and they really sucked. So even if they aren't real, for $13 it's (sorta) worth it.\n",
      "Came In and sounds great\n",
      "Amazing sound quality, not too comfortable, gave me a blister in my ears, but after a few times wearing them they were alright.\n",
      "terrible condition. item came damaged\n",
      "These headphones are HORRENDOUS!! They are NOT apple. They only lasted all 3 of us literally a few days. They sound HORRIBLE!!!! DO NOT BUY THESE!!!!\n",
      "Fast shipping but 100% fake garbage zero star\n",
      "Did not work, so I returned.\n",
      "These are advertised as real Apple earbuds. They are knockoffs.\n",
      "They are great, but after a couple mths the wires fray and unable to hear anything! Unless you enjoy purchasing new earphones every couple of mths go right ahead and buy these.\n",
      "Right when i got the head phones and saw that they had certain defective features. Definitely not what i asked for. Sound quality was not bad but not as good as i expected. please read reveiws before uou buy things like these. Also, when ever i tried to take the photos included with my review it kept taking the picture without my knowing, and if you didnt know, you can take pictures with volume settings.\n",
      "Terrible sound.\n",
      "They are not official Apple earbuds. They look and feel like they are but the sound quality is not so great. I returned them and dished out a little more $ and bought the real ones from the Apple Store.\n",
      "I rarely write reviews but I'm only writing this one out of the concern of people. Initially I bought these headphones blindly thinking they were the real deal. I later came to check the reviews (should of done that at the start) and noticed that it had a ton of negative reviews. I then became worried and was contemplating on canceling my order. But I did manage to find some positive reviews, yet I didn't really trust them. I decided to take my chances any ways and hope for the best. Note: my order was delayed for a couple of days thus giving it the four stars. When my package did arrive, I ended up getting lucky and managed to receive legit iPhone headphones. No double right earbuds, no earwax, no defects. In conclusion, everyone gets a different experience by this seller. I wouldn't recommend buying from them if you don't want to risk receiving knock-off headphones.\n",
      "works great\n",
      "item came broken. no excuse for that\n",
      "My old ones just broke and I'm holding these next to them, its not the same at all. It still sounds good so it gets a pass there but the quality of the physical headphone is not the same as the the genuine apple earpods\n",
      "Need I say more...\n",
      "Not very good\n",
      "Have been using these guys every single day for two years and they are still going strong! How do they do it? I dunno, but I'm glad they did. All the others I've had, you know, the older model, last about a year.\n",
      "Did not work. Completely garbage. Don't believe the positive comments. Also fake.\n",
      "Worst\n",
      "Do not work do not waste your money you might as well pay the extra fifteen to get legit apple headphones\n",
      "When I got my headphones they worked perfectly then the next day I couldn't hear anything out of the right ear bud. I do not suggest buying from this seller.\n",
      "Good deal\n",
      "definitely not OEM Earbuds. Upon disassembly of the casing to try to fix a loose speaker. The speaker size was significantly smaller. The casing around the speaker was very different and only held in with super glue. Wiring significant lower gauge then OEM. Warning NOT OEM!!\n",
      "Why do I do this to myself... Always, always, always read the reviews! Where's the zero-stars button?\n",
      "this sucks so bad. this has horrible volume and the bass sucks too. you can hear it shake from the inside of the earbud, (DONT BUY THIS)\n",
      "Junk!!!!! Do not buy I wish I would have read the reviews first. Lesson learned.... Cord is rigid and ear buds suck\n",
      "I just opened one of the headphones and one of the speakers is blown. I'm VERY disappointed.  I noticed almost immediately that the right side is noticeable low/blown.\n",
      "Will buy again\n",
      "Appear official at first glance, but upon further inspection these are slightly different than the ones that came with my iPhone 6.\n",
      "Nothing special here. Merely a replacement since my old ones broke.\n",
      "Genuine Apple\n",
      "Junk, just spend the money and buy them from Apple, that is what I had to do. The volume control works for a month or so and it was just a waste of money. After about two months the microphone is so bad that they can not be used for phone calls. If you just want something for the gym that are inexpensive, sure these will work. Go to you tube and type in \"how to tell original earbuds\" and you can tell the difference. I should have know the price was too good to be true, OEM, they are not.\n",
      "Junk to say the least!! Sound is horrible they are cheaply made and a piece of crap!! DONT BUY THESE!! I only put one star because otherwise it won't let me submit my comment but ZERO stars is what this product should have!!\n",
      "These are apple product not knockoffs.\n",
      "Broke on the first day\n",

      "They sent me really crappy headphones. I thought I was getting another pair of the Apple headphones, these were a clear cheap knockoff version that sound TERRIBLE.\n",
      "These died on me in 3 months. Very disappointed.\n",
      "Original Apple item - works as intended.\n",
      "They work!\n",
      "Broke in under 2 days.\n",
      "I don't think they are apple, the right ear works only sometimes and I just got them this week. Going to return..perfect condition.. No abuse. The ones I got from apple lasted way longer I even put them through the washer a dryer and they still work fine to this day.\n",
      "Perfecto\n",
      "I bought these to replace my Apple earbuds that lasted many years ...hoping that they were real and not a knockoff.  they are Apple with sturdy build and great sound.  thanks for the fast service too!\n",
      "Good\n",
      "As advertised. Great sound. Make sure to purchase from Amazon and not a different vendor. This will help you avoid fakes.\n",
      "Very convenient and confortable, I don't have to shove them into my ear. They sound great and are perfect for casual listening on the go.\n",
      "Working great. Love my ear buds\n",
      "We bought these to go with an ipod Touch as the earbuds that come with the touch do not have the Mic and volume adjustment on the cord. Good price, apple product, not a knock off.\n",
      "This was dirt cheap here and I was very nervous that they were an off brand. They are not and work great. I am so glad to find such great deals on amazon.\n",
      "These are the real deal! Product is real Apple in plastic case without retail packaging!\n",
      "Great hedphones\n",

      "Just upgraded to an iPhone 5s from  4, so we ( my wife also upgraded ) needed some six footer lightnings so we could charge our phones while laying in bed\n",
      "DO NOT BUY !!!!!!! Took over a MONTH to receive.They sound terrible. These are CHEAP knockoffs.\n",
      "They broke after using it for only about a week\n",
      "Something is very wrong with these earbuds. They work fine but when i go running the static from my shorts causes the earbuds to SHOCK my ears. I had to stop and figure out why it was happening. Very uncomfortable and just not right; never had this problem with earbuds. Ended up learning to run with my phone in my hand to avoid any more shocks. No wonder they're so cheap now.\n",
      "They do their job.\n",
      "original. tested\n",
      "sounds bad\n",
      "They're not original Apple Earbuds.\n",
      "Very cheap material, they broke the 2 day I had them!\n",
      "No complaints with this product at all. I have used Apple EarPods before and just wanted another set to have in my car. The remote for the mic and volume works well. The speakers on the EarPods are fantastic and very clear. I used the mic frequently for phone calls in my car and I have never had a complaint with anyone being able to hear me.\n",
      "I love these head phones. They sound amazing\n",
      "didn't even work !! not worth it\n",
      "Good product, it comes earlier than expect... :)\n",
      "Just what I need!\n",
      "The mic does not work.\n",
      "Broken not even a week after I hit them total rip off\n",
      "Genuine Apple earbuds - Came in a tiny little plastic Apple earpod case.  Very plain, but the Apple insignia was included in the contents of the package under the earpods - so you know they are OEM.\n",
      "Thanks\n",
      "Wow! How disgusting!  I ordered these \"new\" headphones only to get clearly used ones...complete with someone else's ear wax in them!!\n",
      "Headphones have good sound quality. However, they are slightly scratched on the side, perhaps due to packaging. That was the one thing that threw me off. However, good sound. Overall a good product.\n",
      "Great product, great price! These headphones work perfectly and are $7 cheaper than the Apple ones.\n",
      "They worked the first day I bought them and then they just stopped working, the remote mic doesn't even work and half the time I couldn't hear music or phone calls and then they just stopped working all together DONT BUY!\n",
      "The quality is not what I expected and am used to from Amazon purchases.  The incoming sound is not as clear.\n",
      "Its not original but its good enough for the price you are paying. No problems so far\n",
      "not sure why volume and on/off not working\n",
      "these earbuds worked for a few days and just stopped working. :( very poor quality. do not waste your money.\n",
      "I mean they sound fine but I just got them yesterday and if the chord gets bent a certain way the headphone cut out and the chord does even have to bend that much, it's just kinda inconvenient\n",
      "Perfect. Though not OEM.\n",
      "There's not broken yet!\n",
      "I USE WITH MY IPOD TO LISTEN TO BOOKS. I USE IT DAILY & HAS HELD UP VERY WELL.\n",
      "I love it\n",
      "Perfect!\n",
      "These are horrible. They don't work at all. You can't adjust the volume or even hear with them. A waste of time and money.\n",
      "Very happy with my purchase! Love my earpods!\n",
      "Don't last long\n",
      "Day two with the headphones and they already don't work. Don't waste your time buying them they probably aren't even real.\n",
      "Works as expected.\n",
      "I bought these because they were Apple EarPods and when I read the reviews I didn't think they were actually original Apple EarPods. When I got them I saw that they were in fact original Apple EarPods.  Very good quality of sound and have been working great.\n",
      "I don't usually review things but these headphones were so bad I felt compelled to leave a review. These are definitely knock offs (which I would be ok with even though they say OEM but they are also very cheap quality). If you move around while wearing them and build up any static electricity they will shock you in your ear and it can can be quite painful. Additionally one of the headphone split in half the first day I had them, which might be good seeing as they shock you. All in all I would not recommend wasting your couple dollars.\n",
      "Not the real Apple EarPods, the feel and sound quality is much worse.\n",
      "fake\n",
      "Not real Apple EarPods.  Ordered in November and they broke already.  As has happened everytime I have ordered these types of 'Genuine' Apple EarPods from Amazon.  I think you should take heed and order directly from Apple!  Bite the bullet, spend the extra money and get the actual quality product!\n",
      "Horribly tinny. Threw away. NOT Original Manufacturer. Can you say knock off!\n",
      "Real Apple Headphones! Can't complain. They make a good headphone!\n",
      "thanks\n",
      "the remote does NOT work - at all. I have an ipod touch - 3rd gen & the remote didn't work - had to return them.\n",
      "I'm giving these earbuds a 4-star rating based on the fact that they are the exact official earbuds from Apple.  I'm not saying that the Apple earbud design is worth 4-stars by any means, but the product is definitely genuine.  The plastic is quite slippery and I've always had issues preventing them from falling out of my ear.  Sound is what you'd expect, decent but not fantastic.  The openings in the earbuds are quite narrow and have always been prone to getting clogged full of earwax.  As gross as this may sound, for some of us this is a very cruel reality.  Along those lines, if you happen to have more wax/oil production in your ear cavity, you'll also find that they become quite slick and will dislodge with the slightest tug.\n",
      "No\n",
      "The EarPods were the perfect replacement for the lost earphones that originally came with the iPhone. There was no issues with the microphone or the earbuds. It was perfectly compatible with all apple products.\n",
      "Pricing is critical in that fourth star.\n",
      "Work great for the price\n",
      "excellent\n",
      "I guess I got lucky with a good pair? Nothing had happened to them in the first 3 weeks of using them, cords are fine, volume controls are fine. I've tried angling my head and the headphones to start this problem with it apparently going to max volume. It hasn't worked as I'd hoped. Literally nothing is wrong with them, having them connected in my pocket, jumping around, or sitting, everything is still working. I haven't been shocked or anything.\n",
      "My daughter loves them.  They stay in her ears.\n",
      "My daughter loves it.\n",
      "I didn't think these were genuine Apple earpods.  I think a little clever wordplay was misleading.\n",
      "Came apart within a few weeks, took forever to arrive.\n",
      "Amazing\n",
      "For the grandson he like them.\n",
      "Do not work well at all!  Not good quality sound, does not sound like original Apple headphones at all.  The first pair stopped working all together after only a week and I was sent a new one that stopped working as well!\n",
      "As promised\n",
      "THESE ARE REAL ! Ordered them got them fast, & was suprised they were EXACTLY THE SAME AS Apple Earpods, Will Be Buying Again.\n",

      "Are you serious??? It took a whole 2 weeks for it to arrive even though I have Prime Membership. And then, I got over it because I have been waiting for them but they don't work! Only the right works.... I aside m very displeased!!\n",
      "Work perfectly! Shipped on time\n",
      "I have small ears and apple ear buds (with the slant - not the earlier round ones) are the only in ear ones that actually don't fall out. True even with the high end ones that come with different size tips.  Its the slant shape that seems to keep them form slipping.  Good price on these and appear to be actual apple ear pods.\n",
      "The left ear is broken.\n",
      "Perfect\n",
      "Great\n",
      "Fake ear phones that DO NOT WORK AT ALL.  Complete junk.  Throwing them straight in the garbage\n",

      "fast shipping great ear buds\n",
      "I ordered two sets of earbuds. They arrived well in advance of the ETA. Both are indistinguishable from my original Apple earbuds in appearance and quality, except that i saved about $35. It was a small gamble to make but it paid off!\n",
      "not real apple headphones, broke after not even a month of use.\n",
      "Extremely poor and flimsy construction, broke on the first day.\n",

      "THE BEST earbuds I have ever used.\n",
      "The product is not good. Was expecting in packed way similar to how we get it at apple. Also ears hurt when listening to music should be some issue with the plugs.\n",
      "They are what they say they are.\n",
      "I've used these headphones for listening to music and for making calls. It sounds good for music. The buttons are well placed and give good feedback.  I regularly use the mute button during calls. My main complaint is that my ears don't seem to fit well with the buds and tend to get in pain after half an hour. A secondary complaint is that the lowest volume in calls seems to be louder than I'd like. I still continue to use them because of the quality.\n",
      "Broke after 3 weeks\n",
      "The volume and mic didn't work\n",
      "FAKE NOT GEMUINE APPLE they were bad out of the box had a short in cord. They don't feel like apple earbuds the materials don't feel like genuine Apple. the cord was thiner than real apple ones. took 1 day to go bad. COMPLETE WAST OF TIME!!!\n",

      "cool :*\n",
      "Horrific!!!  DO NOT PURCHASE AS THEY ARE FAKES..Especially from seller ZOOER.. The sound quality was the worst I've ever heard..returned my payment immediately, but still NOT WORTH IT!\n",

      "Yes they surpassed my expectations\n",
      "Don't feel like original product at first instance but when compared to sound quality it doesn't feel any difference from original earpods from apple store so I dont think these are duplicate these are damn original itself.\n",
      "Came earlier than expected, work great\n",
      "Works well and good price.\n",
      "These look OEM but the sound is dramatically different. We have a pair that came with our phone and when I accidentally put in this pair I could tell they were different. Compatible with phone and was able to talk hands free (the main reason I got them). They arrived pretty fast for coming from China and they're fine as a backup but don't expect oem quality\n",
      "My favorite ear buds for how they fit in my ears and ease of use.\n",
      "These are not genuine Apple headphones; they are a cheap knockoff. Even though it says that they are sold by Apple, they are actually coming from somewhere else entirely. False advertising.\n",
      "great\n",

      "Works great\n",
      "Don't buy it. It's a Piece of trash.\n",
      "until apple introduced their new shape for their standard earbuds, I wore strictly over ear headphones, because at that time you could only have standard round earbuds, or the typical rubber tips, neither of which liked to stay in my ear or be comfortable. the apple earpods have proven to be perfect, especially for those of us with picky ears. the quality is just fine, they go in, fit and stay in the ear quite well, but come out easy enough for quick removal unlike those pesky sports ear buds with the wraparound. only downside, controls only half work on most android devices (pause/play/skip function but no volume control/back one song function), and on other devices all that works is the mic, but unless you're monumentally lazy and can't use the phone controls, it's not too concerning, and if you do have an apple device then no issues with these earpods at all.\n",
      "Not good at all and were broken the second week I had them.\n",
      "These earbuds stopped working after two days. They suck.\n",
      "As described.\n",
      "Apple's EarPods are even better than their predecessors. They fit well in my ears, and the remote and mic are really handy (my iPhone's mic finally blew out after 4 years). Easily the best set of earbuds I have purchased.\n",
      "the kids love these earbuds!\n",
      "Looking forward to the day Apple has enough and she's Amazon for the continued disregard of the product. I have purchased headphnea countless times and have NEVER...NEVERRRRR received an authentic pair of ear pods. EVER. I'm talking 2 to $300 bucks feed into this corrupt money mill....I wonder how large Amazon's cut is??\n",
      "i brought these for my son he says that the sound is clear , however just like all the other ear buds they dont stay in the ear and if you wear them for a period of time it hurts the inside of your ear.\n",
      "Great product, great sound. Very happy.\n",
      "I thought i was getting apple headphones and I soon found out they were knockoffs. one of the headphones stopped playing after a week. They arent even worth returning it was just a waste of money.\n",
      "I love these headphones! I'm super destructive to any headphones I have no matter what quality. Working around dogs just adds to this problem. These headphones are the perfect compromise between durability and replacement cost. WILL order again and recommend.\n",
      "I got them and they work just like apple. Here and there the mic won't work but nothing major. I still enjoy mu music.\n",
      "Got the EarPods, good delivery time but the remote does not work and the right ear is going out already and I just got them today\n",
      "The packaging was good but these earphones still managed to get damaged, the quality of the sound was pretty bad, and i looked at the little sound remote on the wire and even that was pulled off and I could see the actual wire, not worth my 12$. The case that the Earphones also was scratched and somewhat broken and the little box could not close all the way.\n",
      "Terrible .\n",
      "Very inexpensive EarPods that worked great!\n",
      "Your typically iPhone headlines. Confortat and pretty decent sound quality.\n",
      "Recomended\n",
      "I bought these expecting typical bad knock-off quality but what I got was pretty damn good iphone earpods.  I compared these to real genuine apple earpods and while I could tell a slight difference, I wasn't even sure which one was better and quickly forgot which set of earpods was genuine and which was this one.  The apple earpods don't last nearly as long as they should, so it's great to have an extra pair that don't cost too much\n",
      "earbuds were actually dirty!  gross!  They arrived in a plastic bag..not the protective case as pictured.  The plug was bent where it would attach to the device and did not work.\n",
      "They work fine. They are the real deal. Definitely worth the money.!! Don't work to well for running but that's just because of the shape. This is a good deal.\n",
      "Volume goes up and down out of nowhere.\n",
      "Don't even try it. Not even close to real EarPods quality.\n",
      "Always love these headphones, as they seem to hold up a while and love the pause feature on the earphones.\n",
      "They were not OEM earphones. They were similar in appearance but with thinner wires and the sound was not as good\n",
      "worked as expected\n",
      "Do not buy it. I know the description may look like it is legit original Apple earbuds... However they are not. The quality of the sound is low and nothing like the original earbuds... I cant believe it is sold on Amazon actually.\n",
      "Great quality, will buy again!\n",
      "Horrible. I felt scammed. They felt cheap in my hands and proved so in performance and durability.\n",
      "These work just as well as the ones I received with my phone.\n",
      "Got earpods they looked nice they arrived on time but the product is no good the volume button does nothing and that is why I bought them. That won't happen again!!!!\n",
      "Nice I bought a I phone was missing the OEM ear buds .Only thing is if yur in a hurry forget about theses .They Come on the slow boat from Asia price is great though\n",
      "Excellent\n",
      "I bought three pair.  Definitely NOT an apple product.  Utter s***.  each pair lasted one wear before literally disintegrating.  I want my money back.\n",
      "Bought these as a back up. They work just as good as expensive ones.\n",
      "Could sound better and definitely could have better mic performance, but for the price point, these are fine.\n",
      "Everything alright.\n",
      "On point and excellent product. They're exactly what I expected.\n",
      "Just as expected\n",
      "Not original !!!!! Stopped working within 1 week.\n",
      "These EarPods work great but I've been through at least three pairs. The construction doesn't seem to be high quality as they stop working less than a month after purchasing.\n",

      "One earplug stopped working two days after arrival. Not sure if it is truly original. Very disappointed.\n",
      "I like them and would definitely get them again if needed\n",
      "Nice product with low price, just as the earphones from Apple company. The only disadvantage was that it took a long time for shipping.\n",
      "Best  ear phones ever made trust me buy it\n",
      "These are exactly the headphones I  was replacing. I believe they are authentic apple.\n",
      "These are real apple EarPods they haven ripped cracked etc. Compare to the fake clone one.\n",

      "Great n reliable\n",

      "Bad\n",
      "honestly the worst pair of headphones i have ever owned.  they broke within a week\n",
      "NOT ORIGINAL!!!!\n",
      "I ordered these from Amazon and love them. I got real ones. The sound quality is better than expected for the price and has good bass. I use this with my old iPod nano 4th gen, and my iPad 3rd gen, and all the functions work well. I'd say that no earbuds for Apple products comes close at this price point.\n",
      "One side stop working after 3 days. I purchased 2 and it happened twice.\n",
      "Not real.... But they work I guess, the bass sucks but their somewhat decent, I'd personally buy again if I had too.\n",
      "Received these and when I plug them into any device, they are randomly muting the volume. If i turn the volume back up, it immediately just moves it back down to mute. Extremely dissatisfied.\n",
      "The ones that I got are not authentic. Just after a couple of days of usage, I started hearing static whenever the earphones move while listening to music or making a phone call. I'm so disappointed!\n",
      "Good headphones.\n",
      "Disintegrated in two days\n",
      "These headphones are the best ones Apple has ever made! There aren't any parts that will fall off like the old ones with the rubber. They fit very nicely in your ear and don't cut them. Won't fall out when you're running. Plus they're extremely durable, mine have been through everything; crammed in my pockets all the time and believe it or not been in the washer twice!! Not to mention the amazing sound quality!! I will use these forever!\n",
      "I had no problems with my order they are just like the genuine Apple EarPods I can't tell a sound difference between the two\n",
      "I love these things already! I had previously an authentic pair of Apple Headphones that came in the box with my iPhone 5c, and these headphones are the exact carbon copy of Apple Headphones. I say again: these are REAL Apple Headphones. They have the same clean, clear sound and they feel, smell and look like the real things because they are the real things. I'm sorry that other people have given this product a bad review. Maybe it was just factory defects that they got. What I know is that you should expect the real thing when buying this product.\n",
      "If you want the original apple ones, do not buy them here. It is easy to tell that the microphone and materials are sub-par.\n",
      "Broke two days after I got them... Barely put the volume up. I won't be buying these again\n",
      "This stopped working three days after I got it. The first day one ear bud want working\n",
      "Suits purpose\n",
      "I was really happy but they arrived broken.\n",
      "Seemingly worked fine for the first week. I didn't receive two \"right ear\" buds as many customer reviews here have reported. The jack did break after a week however. My earbuds tend to break every 3-6 months because admittedly I'm not super careful with them and the wear and tear eventually causes one ear to not work properly, but this was honestly pathetic. I've never had earbuds break within a week.\n",
      "Don't buy this !\n",
      "They are my favorite what else needs to be said.\n",
      "This ear buds are not Apple for sure! They came in a small box and not the usual Apple package and it didn't have the usual Apple writing on the back. Also, one of the buds stopped working within three days\n",
      "absolutely satisfied.\n",
      "Awesome!! Real Apple EarPods for a lot cheaper than retail! They work great\n",
      "These are fake, knockoff earbuds. These are NOT the real Apple version. Some have been shipped with earwax in the buds already and some are shipped broken. Please avoid this product.\n",
      "Still some of the best sounding ear buds on the market, could be a little more comfortable though\n",
      "I got real and legitimate Apple headphones\n",
      "There was an aftermarket sticker sealing the product casing with the word \"NEW\" labeled on it. Nice try. There was actual human earwax in the earbud.\n",
      "cheaply made, broke within a couple of days. speakers blew out\n",
      "Great sound,very fast delivery\n",
      "Took almost a month to receive to product and headphones don't play very loud even at maximum volume setting\n",
      "These worked pretty well at first, but then broke after about 2 months of use.  The earbud developed a crack and would pop off and expose the internal speaker.  I am not very hard on my ear buds, so this was a disappointment.  Next time, I will likely spend an extra $10 or $20 to get earbuds that last longer.\n",
      "I don't get why some people dislike Apple Earpods. They fit perfectly in my ears and they are very good sounding.\n",
      "Probably the only in-ear i can wear and feel comfortable, hate those other ones which you gotta stick deep inside. The sound is fine.\n",
      "These were for my son. They fit fine, sounded good, and would have be great...if they had lasted. Unfortunately, one side broke within a few days. Amazon, of course, accepted a return and submitted a refund *very quickly*...can't beat Amazon. We're now searching the store for another set, but we'll look for words like 'sturdily constructed' this time.\n",
      "One ear stopped working the very next day after I receive it.\n",
      "Excellent, no complaints. I'm actually buying another pair\n",
      "I bought the headphones for my girlfriend because she lost her old ones and after a couple days I asked her what she thought and all she could say was the sound quality was great the mic was perfect all here friend could hear her perfectly. I could say I heard her perfectly they worked out of the box. I am very happy because she is happy\n",
      "Sucks.\n",
      "Awesome sound!\n",
      "The Audio quality is terrible\n",
      "One of the ear plugs doesn't work any more.\n",
      "These are 100% Apple headphones. I rated this item 4 stars because the headphone case was practically destroyed.\n",
      "left one sounded like s**t and the right one didn't even work. Dissapointed\n",
      "Quick shipping and delivery. Have had em for about two weeks now; quality sound and no problems with remote or microphones. Would recommend!\n",
      "Headphones are good, but they arrived dirty , as if the person who has had to pack dirty hands.\n",
      "good price!\n",
      "Great product great value.  Christmas present for the daughter.  They were factory and the daughter was happy.\n",
      "Bought 3 pairs - volume control does not work on any of them. I guess you get what you pay for.\n",
      "Clearly an older version of the apple headphones. The ear buds are HUGE, and fall out of my ears. And I don't exactly have the problem with earbuds. I'm wondering if these are knockoffs, since the sound quality is pretty bad.\n",
      "Who buys used earbuds??  Gross\n",
      "Great product. Great price. Exactly what I expected.\n",
      "I feel as if they are not real iPhone earbuds . Due to the fact it has a weird static noise I hear and the microphone doesn't work ... Very weird\n",
      "Poor quailty.\n",
      "Don't buy these! They are fake!\n",
      "Great product, exactly what i expected..\n",
      "Arrived as promised.  Work great!\n",
      "These earbuds came with wax in them!!  I've never been so disgusted. RETURN!\n",
      "Not Apple despite packaging.  Sound only works in left ear. Disputing charge with Visa\n",
      "Love this product and shipping was fast!!\n",
      "Purchased for my daughter and she says that the volume will go out in one of the earpods and she has to move it around to make it work sometimes. I wouldn't get again.\n",
      "Apple have always been perfect !\n",
      "Fake garbage broke in a minute\n",
      "Nice Apple ear buds.\n",
      "My son already broke one in less than three weeks\n",
      "Good\n",
      "Wonderful\n",
      "Not original apple earbuds. The sound isnt so great but you get what you pay for. It did take over a month to deliver but it was a good stocking stuffer.\n",
      "Love these ear bud head sets.\n",
      "This iPhone headphones are the best. They're are Apple.\n",
      "This product is very cheap, and does not work well don't recommend these at all\n",
      "Horrible quality. The volume is so low on the headphones, want refund\n",
      "Broke within a week and I'm very careful. Such a disappoint.\n",
      "Definitely the apple knock-off headphones.  Plastic is cheap, small separation on the volume control pieces, but the sound is good.\n",
      "Very comfortable, fits in the ears nicely.\n",
      "These work, but my son told me (even though they come in apple packaging) they are not the quality Apple product you buy at the store. He said they do not have the clear sound he is used to from his previous earbuds.\n",
      "Broke the first time I used them -_- and took 2 months to get here\n",
      "The microphone works nicely, but there are problems with the sound. Disappointed that I paid so much for bad quality. Also not real Apple EarPods! They are much thinner.\n",
      "Original oem headphones. Better than the ones my phone originally came with.\n",
      "Totally fake.\n",
      "Product received as expected.\n",
      "They broke after the first use. Open wires .\n",
      "very good, excellent\n",
      "These headphones weren't what I expected it to be. First of all the button where you turn up the volume and pause it doesn't even work. Then the quality isnt even iPhone headphone quality. I recommend that you shouldent buy these. If you are looking for quality headphones, dont get these. These are cheap headphones so i would recommend that if you are trying to get cheap headphones then just get some from the store because it takes about a month to deliver anyway\n",
      "Not worth  your time. Biggest peace of s*** ever! !!!!!!\n",
      "Awesone\n",
      "I'm pretty sure the one I received was not authentic. The remote and mic portion of the earphones are not aligned perfectly.\n",
      "Don't even bother buying this piece of junk. My right ear plug broke on me after only a week !! This trash is useless.\n",
      "perfect!\n",
      "Bought these as a gift for my bother. He loves them.\n",
      "These look, sound, feel just like my original Apple EarPods. I have no reason to believe that they aren't OEM. Much better buy than the listed $29.99 EarPods.\n",
      "Okay, I was in serious need of earbuds so I bought these. I wish I had payed attention to the reviews.\n",
      "These are the original ones. The Earpod cover came a little scratched that's the reason I'm giving 3 stars.\n",
      "These ARE NOT THE REAL APPLE EAR BUDS. First off the sound was not good. You can hear out of one way better than the other. Second off the two wires with the heads were not the same length. The left was 1.5+ inches longer than the right. Third they feel cheap and broke easily even though I took good care of them\n",
      "I like the headphones but they broke apart very easily unlike the apple brand you buy from the apple store or best buy.\n",
      "just got them and they seem to be working fine. let's hope they last\n",
      "These are the fake ones no real ones\n",
      "My 18 year old daughter won't use anything else.  She has tiny little ears and these are the most comfortable she has ever worn.\n",
      "Bought these to replace my existing EarPods. The sound quality is sub par, the cord length is shorter than it should be, the material used to make the product is clearly off and the microphone is just awful. The only thing that is right about these \"EarPods\" is the plastic molding for each ear piece.\n",
      "NOT GOOG\n",
      "Due to some of the reviews from customers denying the authenticity, I checked the ones I received. I concluded that mine are indeed Apple authentic. I compared my existing authentic Apple EarPods from an old device. I did some researched on the internet that lead me to the Apple forum. I even stumbled upon a video on youtube that explains and shows clear details on the differences between real and fake ones. For a quick comparison the real Apple EarPods should say \"Designed by Apple in California Assembled in Vietnam...\" followed by a serial number. Huge sigh of relief there.\n",
      "AWESOME Headphones.! Nice and loud with that bass banging. *___* recommended.\n",
      "Amazing headphones i have been using it for a long time and it works very well.\n",
      "Original headphones awesome deal :)\n",
      "I bought a cheap pair and learned my lesson. These a factory replacement. Only buy Apple Cert products if you are going for original equipment replacement.\n",
      "They look great and work great...I used them on my ipod, Samsung Mega, Mac air, and my brothers surface ..not bad so far!\n",
      "I had these not even two weeks and they broke. The right piece stopped working.\n",
      "Thanks\n",
      "Worked for one day. Now sound only comes through one speaker.  Flimsy and cheap.  Don't buy this.\n",
      "The mic cannot work\n",
      "great\n",
      "just what I was looking for\n",
      "FAKE!!! Complete counterfeit. DO NOT BUY! NOT the same as the original from Apple.\n",
      "Bought these as a Christmas present and they were exactly what I was expecting. I was glad to see the price was about $8 less than my local Walmart. I will definitely buy these again if needed.\n",
      "Great. :)\n",
      "Works as advertised.\n",
      "These horrible earphones are the worst.  If it is too good to be true don't buy it.  The microphone fell apart on the first use leaving the wires and internal parts exposed-normally this has never happened to me and over the many years, I have lost headphones after a reasonable amount of time, but I never had any break on me and certainly I have never had the microphone pieces break off.  The sound remained but I would not recommend these to anyone.  I will never buy from OEM again.  Just horrible!\n",
      "Work exactly like the originals that came with phone.  Hopefully they hold up!\n",
      "Does not have the sound quality I was hoping for. Matches the cheap price, so can't complain too much. Still, I will not be using these.\n",
      "Great price! Still going strong!\n",
      "Fake headphones. Mine didn't break but they sound differently compared to the genuine Apple - much less bass.\n",
      "They're NOT terrible. But they definitely do NOT have the same audio quality as Apple's actual designed EarPods. (Yes they're not OEM, differences entail lettering as sound). The advantage is if you forget your favorite headphones when you get to the gym or work you can have these as your backup. When you need something to listen these will faithfully be there.\n",
      "Affordable!\n",
      "The little buttons on the cord that lets you control the volume didn't work, but for the price, it was worth it and it did the job. I've had them for a while and they didn't give out on me yet, I would say go for it.\n",
      "Love the apple stuff, just to expensive.\n",
      "sound/audio clear and pristine love it!!\n",
      "The plugin part broke off in the first 24 hours of opening the package.\n",
      "Fake. At first glance, they appear genuine. However, the two halves of the package doesn't fit well. The sound is tinny and cheap.\n",
      "These headphones didn't work correctly right out of the box.  Sounds are crackly and sound quality is very positional.\n",
      "they work well. my only issue with them is that the covers on the part that goes into your ear comes off & when they're in my purse they fall apart \n",
      "Only one headphone worked.  Did not appear to be an genuine apple product.\n",
      "Poor quality. Not IPhone headphones. You can feel that they are cheap. When I got mine it had been rattling.\n",
      "Absolute s*** headphones. They are fake and have terrible sound. Never buy this product.\n",
      "It works pretty well but it's not genuine and it's not real Apple EarPods\n",
      "Works, but looks and feels a low quality products. --it does work well.\n",
      "My daughter said they are not the original OEM, they have distortion when the volume is raised and break easily but I guess you get what you pay for\n",
      "Awesome\n",
      "Great earphones. Stay in your ears even while running. Sleek design.\n",
      "Very poor quality don't buy it\n",
      "They broke 4 days after buying them.\n",
      "nice looks like the real ones but they are fake\n",
      "People complained that I sounded muffled\n",
      "Headphones broke within a day of having them... I suggest to go buy real headphones.\n",
      "Want another pair\n",
      "I have never even considered writing a product review until this-- they were that bad. I placed my order on November 17. I believe I chose standard shipping, but I expected to receive them relatively quickly. They took over a month to reach me. The packaging implied they came from some knock-off factory in China. I had ordered 3, so I opened only one pair up the first night. These promptly broke before morning (the shell of one of the earbuds broke off without being touched). The next day, I was forced to use the second pair. They broke in the duration of my morning commute. The volume control snapped in half, and the other bud stopped playing sound. Finally, I made the switch to the third pair. The sound barely played in the left ear upon opening the package, and after only a few more minutes, that ear shell snapped off as well. Yes, it was only about 3 bucks, but it is not worth it, especially with shipping. It also means I won't have working headphones for some time, since I was counting on these to not be terrible.\n",
      "not Apple product. the ear bud brock in to 2 pieces when it fell on the floor.\n",
      "They break very easily.\n",
      "Do NOT buy these headphones.  One of the two pairs we bought arrived without one of the earbuds working.  We returned right away for a replacement.  Just after the 30 day return window, one of the earbuds of the other pair as well as the replacement pair had the same issue and we were stuck with them....These are definitiely not Apple Genuine...you could probably buy something better at the Dollar Store.\n",
      "Really Great so far, sound is super good\n",
      "fast service verry good\n",
      "These head phone did no have a good mic piece.  Unable to use when making call.\n",
      "Very good Earbuds I love it\n",
      "perfect.  Stay in my ears!\n",
      "I bought these about a month ago and had to return them because the sound was fading in and out. I exchanged for another pair and just one week into using them the right earphone is not working. I have bought these earphones through Anazon in the past and it hasn't been a problem but I'm starting to wonder if these are actually the same earphones that you get with your iPhone.\n",
      "junk\n",
      "dont work\n",
      "The sound in it is very low quality .\n",
      "good\n",
      "hands down the best headphones i've ever had. I break them all the time but it's never a question if i'll get another pair\n",
      "Theas are boss headphones\n",
      "Not sure if these were real. They fell apart in a month.\n",
      "Comfortable\n",
      "One side stopped working shortly after I got them. The volume buttons also stopped working.\n",
      "At first, I though these headphones were knock offs. I bought them to replace the headphones I recieved with my iPhone 5c, but the sound quality on the new headphones was poor and they felt much cheaper. However, I broke my 5c and replaced it with a 6 less than a month later, and the headphones that came with the iPhone 6 were the exact same as the ones I bought off of Amazon. The new headphones also felt cheaper and had poor sound quality. Turns out, if you look closely, the new headphones say that they are now manufactured in Vietnam, so although the ones I ordered from Amazon were genuine Apple headphones, they are poorer quality than the old Apple EarPods.\n",
      "Works but feels cheap.  The cord material is ick.\n",
      "don't buy,i used 1 week Damaged 1 side not good\n",
      "fits like a glove a great product very very  happyu\n",
      "Great price and excellent quality!\n",
      "They look real enough but one side didn't work. Will be returning them.\n",
      "Got what I expected.  Thank you!\n",
      "dont buy these they are such crap i ordered a few of these each time they break after 1 or 2 light uses. cant return them they want 7$ shipping to return the item is only 11 wtf. do not buy\n",
      "Authentic. Great price. And most importantly, it works!\n",
      "I have bought Apple headphones through Amazon and they were genuine headphones. However, this time I was given fake ones. The sound was very muffled and made crackling sounds occasionally. So I have no chance but to return them. It's very disappointing that I had to wait for a bad product. I recommend you just buy from the Apple site to ensure that it's real.\n",
      "I would never have an iPhone, even as a gift. These earbuds, however, are a great fit & are useable with ANY phone, tablet, or computer.\n",
      "These were amazing for about the first month...until the right earbud stopped working. The mic and volume buttons work but I can't hear anything out of the earbud. Not very happy.\n",
      "This is crap and a rip off\n",
      "works as designed. Great product\n",
      "garbage! they fell apart in two weeks. Don't think it's a real Apple product- The head of the ear piece fell off- and the wires inside do not look like my genuine apple ones. Total waste of my  money.\n",
      "I purchased two of these and one earbud on each pair popped off. I have bought the less expensive ones in the past but the sound quality wasn't the greatest so this time I sprung for these expecting the quality to be better and sound wise it was but the overall quality was much worse.\n",
      "Buy these directly from Amazon when they have it people! The ones from other sellers are more likely than not fake, I got mine from Amazon, they're real. When Amazon themselves are out, get them straight from Apple.\n",
      "Ok head phones\n",
      "Product works great. The only reason I keep buying this product is because I keep losing my headphones. They are the best and most comfortable for listening to music, talking on my phone, and I can run with them and they stay in. I prefer them to most other earphones I have tried, and often use them in lieu of my bluetooth because people can hear me better.\n",
      "Seeing these reviews really scared me becuase I bought 3 of them. And after they were already shipped I saw the reviews and most of them were saying how they were fake. Mine weren't fake. They were the real ones. I was able to tell because apple headphones have like a different sound of beat . Can't really explain it . But don't be scared that you might get fake ones. Because I got good ones that work , sound just fine & are literally by Apple.\n",
      "BUYER BEWARE.  As with many phone accessories I've ordered from Amazon recently, the microphone stopped working 30 days after I bought these.\n",
      "good buy\n",
      "Terrible quality headphones. The right (with control) worked as did the volume control and microphone but the left headphone couldn't change volume and stayed very quiet to the point you couldn't tell it was playing sound until you took out the right headphone and had to concentrate to hear. This was the second pair I ordered of this product and neither pair worked 100% to the desired level.\n",
      "Product as expected\n",
      "This is my second pair of earbuds from Apple.  I use these for con calls and they are great.  After time, the white cables start turning grey from dirt.\n",
      "Nice ear buds\n",
      "Brand new Apple ear buds great price\n",
      "not original\n",
      "I got the item at a really cheap price. I got it safely.\n",
      "As advertised. arrived very fast.\n",
      "Apple products are always good :-)\n",
      "These are a knock off and the quality is bad. Recommend not to buy\n",
      "If you order them from Amazon.com, these are genuine Apple EarPods. The sound quality is just like the original EarPods, and they're brand new--they just come in the little plastic case, without an outer box.\n",
      "Apple earpods are always good\n",
      "Great price!! Delivered fast. Product as described!!\n",
      "It's ok\n",
      "It's apple's original\n",
      "Looks just like my iPhone headphones but the control button broke\n",
      "Pice of s*** don't buy it's fake\n",
      "Prickly_Porcupanzer\n",
      "works amazingly well and for a fraction of the price to replace my Apple ones!\n",
      "Didn't work.\n",
      "got 3 at this price~\n",
      "Work very well, hold up better than the pair I got with my Iphone. Shipping takes a while but they are worth waiting for.\n",
      "This is a cheap knock off of an Apple product the material quality and the sound quality are both very low. Not clear how Amazon even allows this to be sold.\n",
      "i can hear the music.\n",
      "There so fake and came in dirty with dirt on it and smelled like cigarettes smoke don't buy this product\n",
      "Cheap knockoffs!\n",

      "This is a cheap ripoff it broke the first week!!! DO NOT BUY THIS\n",
      "Very good quality, fit perfect in my ears\n",
      "good\n",
      "As soon as I opened the only one of the ears worked  This is JUNK and complete useless... WIll not ever purchase from this company again.\n",
      "FAKE , really bad quality\n",
      "I really love EarPods, they're the only headphones I can comfortably sleep with.\n",
      "Not the best quality and only lasted me about a month till one of the earbuds stop working.\n",
      "This is the second set of these EarPods I have ordered through Amazon, and both have been defective.  The first set had terrible sound, but I did not manage to return it in time for a replacement.  This second set has no sound at all.  I tried both with different players, and the results were always the same.  The original  set that came with my phone work perfectly, making me wonder if the ones I got through Amazon are genuine Apple products.\n",
      "The right earbud would not work within one week of my purchase. It's very disappointing, but for the price I should have assumed that the quality would not be very good.\n",
      "No complaints\n",
      "Works. But not with android phones. (In case you wanted to know.\n",
      "I'm so happy with my purchased,I got them almost half off and they came in there original case and are the original earphones. I recommend to buy\n",
      "Soon as I got them, the head phones had a short. oh well.\n",
      "Very good\n",
      "They work and that's what matters. I'm not an aficionado of electronics by any means, but they do work and the sound is fine.\n",
      "Even though it says \"sold by Apple\" the EarPods I received were not genuine. The build quality didn't even feel like the originals. After using it to listen to music and make calls for a week, I realized the audio quality was also terrible. People had a hard time understanding me over phone calls and the music I listened to didn't sound good at all.\n",
      "Daughter loves it!\n",
      "works very well.\n",
      "I am an expert on apple earphones... And trust me these are NOT REAL!\n",
      "Just no\n",
      "These earphones were exactly like the ones I had bought in the Apple store. Functions well and doesn't break easily.\n",
      "good\n",
      "After three days these headphones was broken...DO NOT BUY!!!\n",
      "Sound is not perfect like Apple earpods provide in original Apple box\n",
      "I like it\n",
      "I figured if I ordered from Amazon, I would get authentic headphones. These were NOT authentic Apple EarPods. Definitely returning these and getting a refund\n",
      "earbuds are fine but it took weeks and weeks for them to be delivered from some very far away place in asia\n",
      "I love it\n",
      "The sound quality in both sides is weak and hollow. No bass at all or any depth in sound. Extremely flat\n",

      "Heads phones broke within a hour of using them. Sound quality was there but one of the buds cracked apart and I couldn't use them anymore. Will not be buying these again. I recommend spending the extra money on some higher quality apple headphones instead of wasting your money hear\n",
      "I'd do a no star. It sucked. Broke in 2 days of having it.\n",
      "They have already stopped working and have only had them for two months\n",
      "These most be the worst headphone I ever purchase. They spouse to original  iPhone not but cheap version\n",
      "THEY DO NOT ACCEPT RETURNS! FRAUDULENT ITEM. VERY POORLY MADE. PRODUCT WAS SENT BROKEN. SOUND WAS POOR. THEY ARE CROOKS! VERY DISGUSTED!\n",
      "Have tried them all and paid equally as much for some but I keep coming back to these.\n",
      "These are not original Apple Earpods, they felt different and sounded terrible\n",

      "nice\n",
      "I got the earpods. The shipment was received on time. But i was disappointed with the quality of earpods i received. The sound just dies off and it keeps disconnecting from my iPhone. So disappointed.\n",
      "They worked ok for like a week and then they completely stopped working. They only sound that comes out sounds like distorted foghorns that vaguely resemble the tones of the sounds you're supposed to be hearing. They also dont seem to be a genuine Apple Product. I do not recommend.\n",
      "They work great! I really love the how much bass the headphones have.\n",
      "Great product\n",
      "Not at all what the item says it is.\n",
      "After 1 month of use, it broke and became useless. Very cheap quality and would not last much longer than a few weeks.\n",

      "I don't like buds that actually lodge into the ear, so these are a good option.  The volume control is nice and sound is good.  I use them all the time when doing yardwork, housework, etc.  Unfortunately they constantly fall out.  I can be standing still and they will just slowly fall out of my ears and drive me a little crazy.  I have not found anything better for the price though and I think it would probably take a clip-on kind to fully avoid annoyances.\n",

      "I bought 3 pairs of this things at the end of May and received them on July of this year. They were dying one by one; the last one passed away at the end of October. R.I.P...  I have started looking for new earbuds; I will try the expensive ones.\n",
      "They have great sound and they say design by Apple in California assembled in China that's how you know u got a legit Apple product\n",

      "I decided to risk it since the seller was Amazon, and I was not disappointed. Came quickly and looks exactly as expected. Sounds perfectly fine - not that I expect great quality anyways.\n",

      "do NOT buy this! Without reading properly, I thought this was sold by Apple, but it's not! Within 1 week of using it, the mic is cloudy when I try to use siri for simple things like what's the weather like or call home etc etc. The up and down buttons for volume stopped working as well!\n",

      "Left ear bud went out after a week of light use at work\n",

      "I spent almost $20 hoping they would last a while and the right headphone didn't work but for a couple hours. If I didn't already use this them I'd ask for another pair or a refund. I'm completely unsatisfied and disappointed.\n",

      "I been an apple user my whole life and I know the apple headphones they feel a little weird like they don't stay in my ear firmly which they come out as. The sound quality is perfect love it can't complain they are 9/10\n",
      "They do break and get lost and there might be better sounding buds out there but these work for me\n",
      "Broken on arrival.\n",
      "These are such great earbuds.\n",
      "Pricey, but great quality.  They wear out after awhile.\n",
      "Obviously fakes. Knock offs! apple headsets have dark Mesh wire covering for the speakers. and the plastic casing is yellowed on the volume control. Multicolors not even on the apple site!\n",
      "For the money I believe these are the absolute best headphones you can purchase. I absolutely love the in-ear buds and these are the most comfortable style I have ever tried. My first pair lasted me 2.5 years with heavy use and harsh treatment. I did not hesitate to replace them with th exact same thing. The sound quality is superb, the comfort level is off the charts, and the durability is excellent. The cord is a bit on the short side, but I use an extender cord and it works extremely well. If you are using these on an ipod or phone you won't have any trouble, but if you are using them for watching movies or videos on your computer, you may wish to consider an extender cord depending on your setup.\n",
      "PIECE OF CRAP!!!!! Not original AT ALL\n",
      "Not the genie Apple product.\n",
      "They work find, but they're not real Apple Headphones\n",

      "That not Work\n",
      "Good!  Very happy\n",
      "You get what you pay for. Microphone stopped woriking after a week. Spend the money buy the actual apple ones.\n",
      "Sure, these things work. Sound comes out of the holes, and the click buttons work for volume control. But the beauty of the Apple EarPods and the earlier Apple earbuds is the no-kink cables. It's difficult to get them tangled up, and they always straighten out. The cables on these from Amazon do not do that.  In fact, they come out of their package pre-kinked. The cables on the EarPods that came with my phone have a rubbery texture to them, and these do not. The case these came in had the apple markings, but the lid doesn't fit very well. I don't feel good about this purchase.\n",
      "Broke after one day of use. The earphones fell apart and wires came undone.\n",
      "lesson learned. Don't buy Apple products unless it's an authorized Apple dealer. These headphones did not work and were obviously NOT new.  Stay far, far away from this vendor!\n",
      "These are definitely NOT authentic.  Granted I wasn't expecting fantastic quality when I bought them, but I was seriously disappointed by this purchase.  I could tell they had been used by the way the cord was wrapped in the packaging.  The sound quality was horrible, compared to the pair I got from Apple, and the materials used were cheap.  If they weren't so inexpensive I would probably ask for my money back.\n",
      "They are the real deal.  The work just like the ones I lost that had come with the phone.\n",
      "these suck. do not buy these, they aren't even apple. they also sound horrible and they broke the same day i got them\n",
      "High quality.  Arrived quickly.\n",
      "these are fake, i received it with two L buds, one L was upside down. they work but it's definitely not from Apple\n",
      "These broke less than ten minutes after I used them. No wonder it's only four dollars. Don't waste your money.\n",
      "Good sound!!\n",
      "Cheap and broke within days\n",
      "Seemed gine at first but within two weeks the left earbud broke even though I babied them.\n",

      "I don't want to jinx it, but for now them are working really well! I recommend getting them! Highly!\n",
      "I LIKE IT\n",
      "sounds good. I hope that this would last for a year or 2.\n",
      "They were exactly what I expected!!\n",
      "Low sound quality. Fall apart quick. Cannot compare to real apple headphones\n",
      "These are cheaply made. Though they have the Apple logo on them they do not have the sound quality or the general textile quality to back that up.\n",
      "These headphones are fake and though they do like they are real they aren't They have terrible sound quality. The sound control doesn't work.\n",
      "So I got my headphone and I was very excited but then like 5 days later one of them broke, it fell apart. I wouldn't recommend buying this.\n",
      "great\n",
      "it would have a better reveiw, IF THEY WORKED. I was very unsatisfied when i ordered these and waited about a month to get them, only to find that they were cracked in several places and when i plugged them up they did not work.\n",
      "These earphones are pretty mediocre. They are just standard earphones. The sound quality is decent enough. I have a really tough time keeping them in my ear and would tend to fall out. Even though this is an Apple product, the quality is just alright.\n",
      "great earbuds haven't had any problems yet so far with them as some of the other reviews say\n",
      "The music is terribly distorted and you really have to know how to edit audio to improve. DO NOT BUY THEY AREN'T APPLE HEADPHONES\n",
      "Poor quality ty broke in a matter of days\n",
      "Worked great for about 4 weeks. Then the ear pieces fell apart. Just after the return policy.....\n",
      "Much much better than the fake \"Apple iPhones\" you can find on Amazon. Authentic and they have a great sound.\n",
      "These are non-USA made.  I don't necessarily have a problem with that, but these are very cheaply made, low quality headphones. I used them once, and then the left side literally split in half. Sorry, I cannot, in good faith, recommended to others.\n",
      "I dont undetstand why earbuds always stop working so quickly after I purchase them. These were neither the best nor the worst.\n",
      "I previously bought DJ style headphones from amazon. I was very satisfied with them but after a while they became inconvient for travel purposes. I have previously owned these headphones with an iphone. I love the fact that the earbud feels comfortable and does not have removable peices like other earbuds. The quality of sound and durability is what you can expect from apple. I am not an apple junkie by any means but I would reccomend them. You may be discouraged by the price but I am telling you it is worth it.They are authentic for any concerned buyers.\n",
      "Right headphone didn't even work. Tried it on multiple devices.\n",
      "They very cheaply made not like the apple headphones at all but they work so at lease one star\n",
      "They came a month later & they were broken . The ear buds did not work .\n",
      "Excellent product, excellent service, excellent experience!!!\n",
      "Perfect\n",
      "these don't work.waste money.\n",
      "Not good quality head phones. Also not as Lon as real apple headphones.\n",
      "Got them for my son. This is what an average 17 year old boy likes today for ear buds I guess.  He used to go through ear buds really fast, but the last pair and this pair have weathered the abuse longer than usual.  Sometimes I think they're fused to his head.  I guess they serve their intended purpose... effectively blunting parental instruction.\n",
      "It's definitely not authentic !\n",
      "Da beats. Really awesome \n",
      "One ear bud stopped working outbof the blue the day after it stopped being eligible for return. Enough said.\n",
      "fell apart the minute I took them out of the case\n",
      "Fake Apple earphones, it broke in less than a week...\n",
      "Terrible I give no stars the head phones came extra late and they were cut up\n",
      "They aren't fake and came as advertised.\n",
      "These earbuds are great they are great quality and hold up really we'll compared to those headphones you get at other stores that only last about a week before you have to throw them away\n",
      "Good quality sound and perfect condition. No issues\n",
      "Apple headphones are great.  I strongly suspect that these, from Magic Mobile Partners, may be knockoffs.  Priced to sell, I bought three pairs.  Two fell apart in my pocket on successive days.  Apple headphones are usually extremely sturdy.  So I'd buy from Apple directly.\n",
      "im so upset about this product. quality is super s*** and the volume buttons dont even work smh. definately not the original this person lyin.\n",
      "I got mine with my iPhone 5c and again with my 6. These hurt and fall out easily. Don't waste your money. I love apple products, but the EarPods are disappointing.\n",
      "Broke down after 3 three days of use.\n",
      "Original Apple\n",
      "Doesn't fit my ear well but still sounds great.\n",
      "This is a poor copy of the Apple earbuds. The look is similar, but the quality is much lower. The earphones lasted two weeks before one stopped working. Also, the surface of the earbuds is not as smooth as that of the original Apple product, and the sound quality is lower. These earbuds may work if handled with extreme care and if sound quality is not an issue, but I would not recommend them. On the plus side, they are cheap.\n",
      "Breaks easily\n",
      "Earpiece did not work when i got them\n",
      "good\n",
      "two out of the three headphone sets did not work.\n",
      "They're great\n",
      "DO NOT BUY !!!!!\n",
      "I bought this item so I can use it with my cell phone while I drive since it has a mic.  Well the mic doesn't work.  I want a refund.\n",
      "Shipping takes too long and they don't have any base.\n",
      "Worst sound quality I have ever heard. Took a month to be delivered, would not recommend to my worst enemy and I threw them out as soon as I could get to a trash can.\n",
      "these were terrible. the sound quality was nothing like the apple headphones and they broke the day after i got them.\n",
      "Thank you\n",
      "Cheaply Made NOT THE ORIGINALS\n",
      "Cheap\n",
      "Took 2 months to receive broken headphones. Not impressed.\n",
      "These work great.\n",
      "Took a bit to arrive, but legit product!\n",
      "they are so FAKE\n",
      "I'm not sure if these are real I purchased straight from Amazon but they broke in less than 3 weeks out of the box brand new. I stored them in my home just as replacement in case something happened to the ones that came with my iPhone. Surprisingly, the one that came with my iPhone went through storms and tornadoes and are still working. They were even stepped upon and they are still working great. I replaced the originals with the ones from Amazon even though the originals are still working. Terrible surprise and I am not amused at all\n",
      "Extremely satisfied. Received in about 3 days. Earpods are great!\n",
      "I am very pleased with these headsets I bought a few extra for my other devices I total recommand them!!\n",
      "thank you\n",
      "Poor quality\n",
      "Good sound, but they break easy.\n",
      "These serve their purpose very well. These are the only earbuds that actually stay in my ear. The sound quality is pretty decent. They're no Audio-Technica studio headphones, but you won't buy earbuds for anything like that. These are the earbuds of my choice.\n",
      "Not so great\n",
      "excellent!! A+\n",
      "Its so horrible that it shouldnt even require 1 star. These iphone headphones are fake.\n",
      "Great\n",
      "I don't like them\n",
      "Broke after first use. Do not buy!\n",
      "I bought it for my husband and I can barely hear him while he is on headphone. Do not buy this product.\n",
      "Amazing value\n",
      "Great earbuds\n",
      "Totally NOT authentic but..... they do just fine.\n",
      "Awesome for the price.\n",
      "I bought these and the the cap feel of while taking it out the package and the volume rocker and mic do not work\n",
      "They lasted just like 4 days, then I had to throw them out. Better to but an expensive pair.\n",
      "Do not buy. Sound horrible. Sometimes left ear doesn't work, sometimes the right doesn't. The wires are also showing and about to rip out of the headphone adapter. Waste of money!!!!\n",
      "Good people thank you\n",
      "When I got them literally right out of the packaging I turned them on and the right side didn't work also the bottom of the headphones where you plug it into the phone you can see there was a  tear on the wire very cheap quality not worth it\n",
      "I really like these earpods.  Work fine, no problems\n",
      "nice product\n",
      "The first day I had them the volume adjuster broke. I have to use tape to keep it together & now it only turns the volume up but I have a hard time turning it down. They still play music so it's fine, still I wish didn't break the first day.\n",
      "These head phones are horrible. I first of all they aren't even Iphone ear buds. Second the microphone does not work. Third the cord is short. And lastly they aren't even loud.\n",
      "Sounds great. Just what I aspected!\n",
      "Do NOT order these earbuds. I ordered a pair in September and got them in November. When I received the package in the mail, which not to mention had been shipping for a good two months, there was a blue wire poking out of the microphone and volume control button. When I used them, only one of the earbuds had actually worked. The sound quality wasn't all that great either. Would not reccommend whatsoever.\n",
      "When my grands visit they always need to borrow headphones while they play games, text messages  and answer their phones - it's nice to have several good phone headsets in the house\n",
      "I bought 2 pairs of these headphone and both pairs broke within a month. The remote stops working and when I used a new pair it an earbud stopped working within a week.\n",
      "Broke apart in a few days. I compared the sound quality with the Genuine Apple earpods and these are not up to par.\n",
      "Good quality headphones, excellent bass\n",
      "For headphones less than $5 I wasn't expecting much, but this thing broke on the second day of me using it!!!!. The left bud completely fell apart and all that's left of it is the wiring. Definitely a waste of money.\n",
      "Bought as a replacement for my old and worn Apple earphones that came with my iPhone 4S. I think there are lots of fake (counterfait) Apple earpods around but I believe these are authentic (I think I'd noticed if they were not!)\n",
      "Loud earphones. I like the mic & volume control. Apple never disappoints\n",
      "Not original Apple EarPods\n",
      "It was just as I had expected. Thanks!\n",
      "Earbuds as described. work great.  Delivery was a bit slow, but that could have been the choice I made in shipping.  Overall happy with purchase.\n",
      "Clearly the product was very damage,couldn't hear or talk on the phone with it.\n",
      "I wrote a good review about these but turns out that in about a week after I had gotten them, one of the ear pieces had a crack in it which made if possible to twist it off and also the buttons with the mic are really loud when you press on them. It's a bit embarrassing when you're in a dead-silent room.\n",
      "they took awhile to ship which is understandable but then when i got them the cord was very short and the sound was just awful.  Luckily I found a better pair on the side of the road later that day.  I would advise not to buy these.\n",
      "Apple through and through!!  Great product! a Must for music lovers!  I receive this product for free or a discount for my honest opinion.\n",
      "Not work all\n",
      "Used three times wire is already pulling out and one headphone is blown out and fell apart. Absolute junk\n",
      "Can get much cheaper headphones, but I believe these are worth it for their quality.\n",
      "Not an apple product. Headphones work to listen music. But to talk over phone no.\n",
      "These are absolutely not authentic as the listing claims. They are cheap knock offs and are horrible quality. Of the 3 pairs I bought none of them worked. Now given the price I wasn't expecting fantastic ear buds but since they were listed as authentic I figured they were Apple brand but may have had cosmetic flaws, therefore unable to sell at a regular retail price. This is simply not the case. These are useless and I confirmed with Apple that these are not in anyway their products, defective or otherwise. The only reason I am giving them 1 star is because no stars isn't an option.\n",
      "NOT Apple product!  Says the item is manufactured by Apple, it is a lie!  These are terrible knockoffs.  White noise in each ear immediately on first plugging them in and the Volume controls don't work at all.  FAKE!!!!!\n",
      "Just broke after two days. It seems they were not strong as apple's regular headphones\n",
      "The ones that I gat were very real and legit. I know because on the cord near the jack it says designed by Apple in California assembled in China which is a clear sign they are real, plus they sound great\n",
      "THIS IS REAL APPLE EarPods i'm an Apple user I've been searching for earbuds like these and they were fake but this one is real\n",
      "Good headphones!\n",
      "Of course they're perfect!\n",
      "It is not original.I could not use it is broken.\n",
      "These are my favorite headphones! They fit perfectly into my ears and have less chance of falling out than headphones with different designs. The sound quality of these headphones is pretty astounding considering the price. They can get very loud and the sound is clear (not scratchy) coming through these headphones.\n",
      "Only one ear side of the ear pods works. Not a trusted buyer\n",
      "Not original product ( OEM) these are fake cheap version, mine arrived not working, you can hear but the MIC does not work.\n",
      "fake, feel bad about this.\n",
      "Cheap head phones don't compare to the real apple bud's.\n",
      "I barely used them and after 2 months they broke. Bad quality :(\n",
      "Fake.! Poor sound quality.! Don't waste your money.\n",
      "Great quality\n",
      "suenan pesimo\n",
      "Right away when I bought them, I realized that they were nowhere near as good as my other earbuds, which I have been using for several years. The sound quality was gritty and hard to hear at times. I used them for just over a day before they broke. Do not buy, very cheaply made. Not worth any money at all.\n",
      "They suck  dont buy it\n",
      "Im sorry, but i just got them and i cant hear from the left side and the mic dont work. I am truly disapointed. I really want this headphones.\n",
      "Terrible. Product broke within days of me receiving it.\n",
      "They're not load.\n",
      "This piece of junk took over a month to arrive and the earphones fell apart within one day of use.  Don't waste your time or your money on this! When purchased I was told it would arrive in 7-10 business days. It arrived over 1 month later and is clearly a poorly made imitation.\n",
      "Sound clear and bass as Bose\n",
      "I received a knockoff set. Mic didn't work and the sound was sub-par. Ive had the real deal and what I received was not it. i recommend buying directly from Apple or Amazon directly.\n",
      "These work really well (sound, volume control) but they do not fit well inside the ears. I was expecting something more akin to the Skullcandy brand that fit down into the ears. These kind of barely sit in the ears. I'm not confident using them around other people as I'm sure anyone near me can hear the music/conversation coming from the ear pieces.\n",
      "Appear slightly different than any Apple EarBuds/EarPods I've ever had come with an Apple Device.\n",
      "Good head phones\n",
      "DONT BUY ! ITS FAKE APPLE EARPHONES\n",
      "I didn't purchase it:)\n",
      "very good\n",
      "They broke within three days.\n",
      "These are not Apple EarPods. They are a lot similar to them, but not as comfortable and the buttons do not push as easy as real Apple EarPods do. After a few minutes of using these, my ears ache. With the Apple EarPods, I never had a problem. Highly disappointed and DO NOT Reccomend.\n",
      "Good\n",
      "we got 4 sets  of these for my husband.  the first thing he did was leave a set in his pocket and throw his shirt in the wash.  oh dear.  after drying out they still work.  definitely a keeper.\n",
      "100% legit Apple headphones\n",
      "It worked only 1 week. Then stopped to work!\n",
      "Bought these earbuds two months ago and they've completely stopped working today. The volume button never worked, but that wasn't a big deal to me. The plastic around one ear bud cracked a few weeks after purchasing, causing the inner components to be exposed occasionally, but this was still just a minor inconvenience. Today though the plug stopped connecting to the phone. I wouldn't buy these again.\n",
      "There are no better earbuds on the planet.\n",
      "Apple product sucks more than I thought. I bought two pairs of these. The first pair worked for a couple weeks, then fell apart. I stupidly bought another pair, thinking I'd just bought a lemon last time. The second pair didn't work at all, as soon as I took it out of the packaging.\n",
      "I have had these EarPods for over 2 years and now it's time for a new pair. I will definitely buy again.\n",
      "Fake\n",
      "I love the sound of these earphones. They have a surprising amount of bass for earphones that do not seal in your ear canal. I feel overall that they have a nice flat sound signature and would work well for any type of music.\n",
      "They work for awhile, but some pairs will fail or crack in less than 6 months\n",
      "Best sound ever.\n",
      "yes good\n",
      "These replicas are JUNK.  Sound is crap.  Mic can't make calls.  Very disappointed.  Should report to Amazon: They are NOT OEM!!\n",
      "great earpods - love them!\n",

      "After a week and some day my right earbud randomly stopped working, on FaceTime the other person says very weird noises are apparent but I can't hear them, earbud came dented in and white&clear contained it comes in was broke\n",
      "Product is good\n",
      "A wonderful \n",
      "The right side of the earphone didn't work at all and the charger didn't even charge my phone. Don't waste your money on these products.\n",
      "Very good product!\n",
      "These headphones feel apart after only two months. I bought them at the end of August and the covers for the earbuds themselves just fell off. Not sure where this supplier gets their stuff but I do not recommend it.\n",
      "What I received in the mail were most certainly not real Apple earbuds, but knock off versions akin to the $15 earbuds you might buy at a convenience store. For $20, they get the job done, but if you're looking to match the quality of earbuds from an actual Apple store, these definitely isn't what you're looking for.\n",
      "awsome\n",
      "They had terrible sound quality and shorted out after a month of use.\n",
      "Awesome Apple EarPods, remote and Mic work amazing.\n",
      "The microphone did not work when i connected it to my Samsung S3. I bought 3 of these, and neither of them worked. Other headsets with microphones have subsequently worked fine with my phone.\n",
      "The pair I received were likely counterfeit. Different feel to the cables from the split up to the ear buds. Sound was OK listening, but the mic consistently dropped out on Skype calls. Price was too good to be true. Ended up losing them but can't feel too bad about it.\n",
      "They are repro's for an iPhone 4\n",
      "Bad sound - was not satisfied.\n",
      "The worst purchase ever done.opened the package. I couldnt properly listen to as single song.\n",
      "These earbuds work very well and the sound is very good. I love them.\n",
      "Cheap knock off headphones. I thought they were apple headphones but I made a mistake\n",
      "Sound fantastic!\n",
      "Really bad\n",
      "Nike\n",
      "People cant hear me and I have to shout\n",
      "Terrible lasted long enough that I could no longer return them. In a little over a month the left speaker no longer works and the right one is hanging on by a thread. The sound quality is also not great. I guess you get what you pay for.\n",
      "Awesome quality .\n",
      "FAKE MICROPHONE. I broke the to see if they had the mic and it was all fake just a regular set of head phones.\n",
      "Terrible. Thought this was an apple set and was so disappointed. The sound is so muffled and fuzzy.\n",
      "Works\n",
      "I should have bought these sooner. People can finally hear me clearly on all of my WebEx meetings.\n",
      "Sound quality is excellent. Earbuds fit perfectly in my ears making it relatively comfortable compared to other earbuds.\n",
      "Laughable. I am sorry I wasted my time. You get what you pay for in this instance. Item said OEM but was nowhere near the quality of original. Counterfeit  packaging as well. Shipped from Amazon. Shame on you. I expected better.\n",
      "Affordable, good quality, delivered when stated.\n",
      "They work....but I certainly notice the difference in quality between these & ones I had purchased at the apple store....but as said they work & are cheap so worth it if the break!\n",
      "These headphones were terrible. The sound was so bad! I would suggest just spending the $25-$30 for real ones. It seems every off brand either sound horrible or break easily and these defiantly were one of them!\n",
      "I gave them to my grand son and he liked them very much it was what he wanted\n",
      "Here I was all excited to receive these to replace a set I had lost.  Of course the price seemed to good to be true.  It was!  They do work.  They do their job.  However, they aren't authentic Apple headphones.  I sometimes wish Amazon could find a way to vet products as being authentic but it is buyer beware.  If you need to replace your headphones and need the mic these will work just know they aren't the authentic Apple headphones.\n",
      "One of the ear buds were broken I could hear something wiggling around inside of it, it doesn't block out sound, no base at all really, it just sounded horrible...  Not like the actual iPod ear buds sorry but I would give it no stars if I could...\n",
      "DON'T BUY THIS!!!!!\n",
      "They look new but something is wrong with the microphone because according to people I talk to on the phone say I go quiet then loud again...:-/\n",
      "Horrible. They feel nothing like the apple headphone. I wish Amazon wouldn't allow fakes to sold under the pretense of being real apple headphones.\n",
      "Definitely not OEM quality! The sound quality on these is no where near as rich sounding as the ones that came with my iPhone! Don't be fooled!\n",
      "I have purchased these headphones more than once. The bass of these particular headphones is tremendous. Also for the price, these are the best headphones.\n",
      "cheap knockoffs of already cheap headphones\n",
      "Good deal.\n",
      "Not OEM. OEM mean Original Equipment Manufacturer, its not the same manufacturer.\n",
      "These are the worst and not real apple headphones.\n",
      "These are the real McCoy - Apple earbuds. Outstanding performance and at the best price I could find - about a $5 discount off the list price. There are lots of knockoffs out there at deeply discounted prices but they just don't perform and they break very easily. I have wasted money on those cheap imitations and ended up throwing them away. I have found it to be cheaper in the long run to buy the more expensive Apple earbuds.\n",
      "Garbage.  Fake.  Terrible quality.  You're better off buying a cheap pair of buds at Best Buy or something.  Absolutely atrocious.\n",
      "Good\n",
      "They are fake\n",
      "Don't buy this it broke within 2 days of using it ans it took 3 weeks to deliver. S***ty product\n",
      "Great product for a low price.\n",
      "They ripped when I got them\n",
      "It was working properly. But it needs to be packed in its Apple package, not only case itself. It is actually hard to figure out whether it is really new item\n",
      "A+\n",
      "Apple headphones are great. I will never purchase another pair of headphones. There's no need to blow your cash on beats unless you need the noise canceling factor. These earbuds fit my ears which says a lot consider how oddly shaped my ears are. They are super comfortable and I love them.\n",
      "Works really good haven't had any problems.\n",
      "Its perfect\n",
      "I'm very upset with my earphones because I wait so long and the does not work the volume and the stop and change music button. They're not a regional they are fake.\n",
      "they are really bad!!! Do not buy these!!! Don't be cheap and buy the real ones!\n",
      "Work really good\n",
      "I was pretty skeptical when I found these online for under $5, but so far they seem to be completely worth the money.\n",
      "Not original apple earbuds! They magically fall apart in a week and I have to throw them..\n",
      "If I know one thing about these earpods it is that they are not original!\n",
      "These headphones are terrible. They kink and I had them for two days before they weren't useable.\n",
      "Amazing\n",
      "I don't know if these are real, but I love how they sound. the bass isn't set-up in a way that is the equivalent of an 80's hair style, begging to be noticed, and the mids and highs don't make me wonder if this is what it feels like to jab pencils into my ears. Just a well rounded, full yet not overly saturated sound. Perfect for travel!\n",
      "They're fake. Not Apple headphones\n",
      "terrible\n",
      "DO NOT BUY.  False advertising.  Not an Apple product.  Would give 0 Stars if possible.  Construction is cheap and flimsy.  Sound quality is awful.  They 'rattle' brand new out of the package.  Lasted a matter of days.  Now they are landfill.  DO NOT BUY.\n",
      "good for the price\n",
      "work well and good price.\n",
      "Worked as expected\n",
      "Super short, bad sound quality, not real.\n",
      "great\n",
      "They didn't work when I received them .\n",
      "Mine stopped working after less than 2 weeks of using them\n",
      "Not original, don't buy! Bad sound quality.\n",
      "good\n",
      "great price fast delivery\n",
      "These EarPods are new, but they are functioning just great. So far, so good. I am happy.\n",
      "They are very functional.  I am Gald I bought it from the source.\n",
      "So good\n",
      "Apple makes the most comfortable ear buds at all I have tried.\n",
      "Worked for a while but either the volume remote of the right earphone stopped working\n",
      "Item just described.\n",
      "I just recently ordered these for an upcoming weekend trip to use while on an airplane.  I didn't open the box until I reached the airport, and as soon as I plugged in the headphones to listen to music, the sound would cut out in the left ear.  I'm not sure if this pair was just defective, or if this is typical of Apple headphones -- but at any rate -- I paid money for headphones that didn't even last for one song.\n",
      "Would strongly advise against purchasing these crappy knock offs. The build quality is terrible. Bought two pairs, one lasted a week before the cable frayed and one broke as I was removing it from the packaging.\n",
      "Terrible quality they all broke within days not worth it\n",
      "Bad. The treble sounds tinny and the bass sounds like I am tapping my finger on a textbook. My Chinese knockoffs produce a better quality sound.\n",
      "Had to send the first pair back because the mic didn't work!\n",
      "Cheap, not OEM. Took 14 days to arrive\n",
      "On receiving this product i realized where one side seemed to experience a lower output (Left Side) after using it the first day. this issue went away and returned again a week after. I then experienced some static like sound with the earphones as if i was experiencing shorts and inconsistent bass output, all of this after owning this item for 2 weeks.\n",
      "They are certainly original....somethings, but not apple earbuds.  Which, considering the price, I was expecting.  But the earbuds - which got to me super-quick - have a cord that has slices in the covering and has bare wire in one spot and a defective join at the connector.  I bought them for my teenager that goes thru earbuds like they are water.  But these are not even usable.  Skip this one and pay more for the higher quality knock-offs instead.\n",
      "The ones I got were not from Apple ...just looked like them.  Worked for about a day and then broke. My real apple ones ordered from the Apple store work great.\n",
      "Arrived like new but upon opening the case I notice they were used and not even fully cleaned. There were signs that these could be authentic but dont be fooled, the smooth plastic wiring is not genuine Apple. These are knock offs, then again still more or less working headphones with much to be desired.\n",
      "These should not have been advertised as \"Apple\" headphones. They aren't in any way close to the quality of the $5.00 headphones I've bought from Family Dollar. If it's too good to be true...\n",
      "The head on both of the earphones fell off within a week. This wasn't a good product.\n",
      "As expected\n",
      "These are horrible not even Apple and cheap material very disappointed..\n",
      "this is the best headphone i have had in my entire life it have an amazing bass,plus it make every songs in my phone sound better this is an amazing product.\n",
      "They work! They provided what they said they would.\n",
      "We'll they were not real!!! They were an ok yet not good at all. They lasted 2 to 3 weeks then they stop working.\n",
      "Ordered new Apple EarPods with mic......when I received them, they were obviously used. Had dirt on them, and in them, As well as wear and tear on the wires. Very disappointed.\n",
      "Just go to Apple and buy the real thing.\n",
      "Very nice! It was what we expected :)\n",
      "These are NOT Apple!!!!!!!  The side with the Mic control stopped working with in a couple of days, rendering the Earbuds totally useless.  We purchased 4 pairs with the same result from all of them.  The case had the apple logo on it too.  These are a total rip off and false advertising.\n",
      "was great\n",
      "I brought this 1 year ago. Used it 24/7. And only now it broke. Very durable and high quality\n",
      "Deceiving packaging, headphones fake asf...\n",
      "Very disappointed. Headphones came today NOT factory sealed and without typical Apple packaging. Earbuds container came scuffed and already opened. If you want the real thing order directly from Apple\n",
      "Good quality until I misplaced it ;(\n",
      "These headphones came to me disgustingly dirty with ear wax on the earbuds AND the chords itself. The tiny little bag it came in smells bad, and I can't even hold the headphones without a napkin. The earbuds themselves are cracked in places. Total rip off. I wish there was an option for 0 stars because what I received was crap. $7 for something I can't even use due to hygiene issues. DISGUSTING.\n",
      "False advertising!  These are nowhere even close to \"Apple\"  anything.\n",
      "Don't work while I'm on the phone \n",
      "Kind of crappy.  You get what you pay for.\n",
      "Cheap and works well!\n",
      "So disappointed came broken I opened it wanted to listen to music then music in one ear and nothing in the other completely ridiculous and shipping took forever with no shipping update so disappointed\n",
      "Head phones work well but leave a constant buzzing in other persons ear when using for a phone call\n",
      "It's a good pair of headphones, but don't say its by apple when its really not. i paid three extra dollars for nothing\n",
      "Very goid\n",
      "Listen, if you think you are gonna pay 3 dollars and get a pair of top notch headphones you are sadly mistaken. These are a pair of 3 dollar headphones without a doubt. they are not durable, they don't sound the best, and they are definitely not OEM. But seriously, they were maybe 3 dollars a piece dollars, what more could you expect. So ignore the idiots that are whining about the quality. If you want quality, dig deeper in the wallet, but don't mislead broke college kids. They are cheap, but they fill my ears with music, and if thats only for a week, I can throw them away and grab another pair from my pack of three and listen for another week while i save for some real ones. Quit being ungrateful, whining tits.\n",
      "These headphones lack bass and balance. Note even close to the orginal headphone quality. Is \"tinny\" a word? Avoid this one.\n",
      "These were defective. I had to send them back.\n",
      "Good product\n",
      "Clearly not Apple headphones.  They may look like them, but it's obvious by the weight and construction that they are just that - look alikes.\n",
      "Work fantastically. Have yet to have any issues with them and I've had them for a few months now. Definitely worth the buy instead of going through Apple directly!\n",
      "Great ear fit.\n",
      "Great Packaging Looks Almost Real But Lacks Bass Sounds staticky when Music Is Playing Looks used With little Tears on it\n",
      "These are not the same quality as true apple ear pods.  There is an echo-y quality to the sound.\n",
      "Apple Earpods arrived in bad condition. I realize they are used but the ad states \"light usage, good condition.\" It is apparent that these were heavily used - the wire strain relief collar at the plug and earbuds has been ripped off with use causing the headphones to short out and one or both fail during use. The earpods were not even cleaned before shipping and arrived filthy.\n",
      "Wish I can rate it 0 you have to keep twisting the part where you plug it in because it doesn't work some ways and literally got it delivered 5 minutes ago!!! and microphone doesn't work at all DONT BUY!!!\n",
      "Not OEM, Junk, that sounds like your in a hollow log.\n",
      "Kinda cheap sounding, but what can you expect. It's not super high quality but its okay.\n",
      "Compared side by side with actual iphone earphones, they both look different (different mesh) and sound different (slightly lower audio quality. Decent, but I could tell eyes closed which sound came from the earphones that came with the iphone and these.).\n",
      "horrible, they dont even work.\n",
      "Original OEM my azz!\n",
      "These are the worst headphones, not worth the $5. The microphone does not work, the sound quality is horrible, and they fall apart in your ears. Do not buy, these are not apple headphones, just cheap knockoffs.\n",
      "Two months to get delivered and product broke the first week.\n",
      "Comfortable and nice.\n",
      "Bought a new pair of earphones because one of my earbuds on the old pair were broken. I was excited to get these because i was tired of running and listening to music in one ear, just to find out these were broken. the funny thing is, the same exact side as my old pair was broken haha. tried this on other iPods/mp3 players to confirm that it was indeed the ear phones that were not functioning. not pleased at all with the purchase and will be looking up how to return them.\n",
      "Broke within 2.5 months with light to moderate use.\n",
      "These are a huge improvement over the original iPod/iPhone earbuds.  The fit is great, and the sound is crisper and more clear...  and the shape is worlds better.  When I occasionally misplace mine for a day or two and go back to the original earbuds, it's incredibly noticeable how poor of a fit the old ones are in comparison to these.\n",
      "Only worked for a few days then stopped working. Headphone wires are super thin and cheaply made unlike Apple headphones. Do not buy!! Spend a few more dollars for some real ones. These come in a Apple casing when they are not.\n",
      "on time, as described, great price.\n",
      "I got it and the mic and the volume buttons just don't work and neither does the talking peice the only thing it's good for is listing to music\n",
      "I lose my own lol, but these are the real deal\n",
      "100% the real thing\n",
      "They broke within a few days.  The sound was not great.  There was an echo.  I definitely do not believe these were original apple ear buds =( #Fail\n",
      "I was going to buy this product but after reading the reviews I decided not to. Thank you everyone for your honest reviews!\n",
      "These headphones are definitely apple headphones. I ordered a pair because I broke the ones that came with my phone, and these were a good replacement. My left head phone did randomly stop working (which is why i'm giving them a 4/5) BUT amazon did agree to give me a refund which I plan on using to purchase another pair. Hopefully they don't break again.\n",
      "From the time I got them, the remote didn't work very well and had to be pressed pretty hard for the phone to register it. Then a month later, the right earphone stopped working! If you want to ensure that the earphones are authentic, I would recommend buying from the Apple Store website.\n",
      "I don't hate the product, but it didn't have a clear sound.  These are definitely not \"Original OEM iPhone\" headphones. I know that if I want great headphones, I'l have to pay for it. However, these were not even decent headphones because the music or person I was trying to hear sounded fuzzy and far away. I bought two of these headphones and one was worse than the other. You know how after using your headphones for a long time and it starts to go bad when you have to turn around the plug in the phone, to hear if the sound gets better. Yea, it was like that off the bat. The material felt different and cheaper then my old apple headphones. It felt more plastic. It came fast, but the packaging looked like apple cases were used for non-apple headphones. The case was scratched up, but there was nothing in the box that could have scratched it. I'm assuming it got scratched before being packaged. I just received it last night, but I'm returning it.\n",
      "allowing and promoting this\n",
      "As advertised but found much cheaper other places after I purchased!\n",
      "Very bad quality. It broke very fast.\n",
      "I'm using one set of the EarPods right now. They work great and are a lot cheaper than buying them from Apple\n",
      "These are counterfeit Apple earbuds that won't last more than a month. The ear pieces themselves came apart at the manufacturing seam, and the right headphone no longer works. These are not genuine apple earbuds either, they are a cheap knock off. I'd rather have bought legitimate apple products that will last, than these cheap pieces of garbage.\n",
      "Plasticy headphones that felt cheap\n",
      "I love these IPhone headhones. Great sound, great quality\n",
      "Within two days I lost sound in one ear.  I have a tough time believing these are genuine Apple earbuds but regardless, very shoddy quality.\n",
      "Very easy process!\n",
      "Great\n",
      "Terrible. Not even an official Apple product.\n",
      "excellent\n",
      "It was ight\n",
      "broke pretty easily but you get what you pay for.\n",
      "product is terrible quality.  dont buy from them\n",
      "Took a month to arrive, and then came apart after a week ...\n",
      "These are exactly the OEM product that you by from the Apply Store.... only it is 1/3 the price.  This is one of the best finds/deals on Amazon.\n",
      "I bought this earpods a few years ago, and I don't use them quite much... They are very uncomfortable to my ears, they are hard. The only thing I like from them is the quality of sound, but besides that, there's nothing much to say\n",
      "it broke in like 2 weeks, waste of money. but i guess it depends on how you use it.\n",
      "Not real earbuds.\n",
      "For $2.60 including free shipping it would be foolish to expect much.\n",
      "worst things ever .It shipped a wrong earphone.  Don't buy it\n",
      "Fast delivery, work great !! Will be ordering another pair for back up.\n",
      "My headphones got a shortage within a week\n",
      "Broke in 5 days\n",
      "Arrived quickly, and they work pretty well. My only issue is that the volume control doesn't work...but that might be because I use them with my android and not an iPhone...\n",
      "At first I thought these were the original iPhone headsets. I was wrong. After my first use at the gym, one of the ear pieces fell apart and lost it! Don't purchase!!\n",
      "Can't believe these are a genuine Apple product. If they are, then they are absolutely a defective lemon. The pinch control on the microphone does not work to stop/start the audio. They have not worked properly from the get-go.\n",
      "Fell apart shortly after buying Would not recommend.\n",
      "These are terrible and not the quality of actual apple earbuds.  Nobody can hear you if you want to use the microphone.  Awful product.\n",
      "Total waste of my money!! Broke the first day I had them!!!\n",
      "Their working great\n",
      "Dope. Great customer service\n",
      "No, it does not work with ipne 5s.  It does not fit.  This must be an old model\n",
      "I recieved defective item.right ear plug not worked.:((\n",
      "Broke day 2\n",
      "Broke after 2 days\n",
      "Great!\n",
      "Not worth it, but I guess you get what you pay for here. After only a day, the headphones were already coming apart, and there is terrible feedback when attempting to make a phone call. I would not recommend to anyone, nor would I purchase again. Spend the extra money for a pair that actually works!\n",
      "like the fit, definitely an improvement over older model\n",
      "Great headphones just messed up quickly\n",
      "That's not the orginal one.\n",
      "Stopped working after just one use. Do not buy these!\n",
      "Awesome Sound Quality\n",
      "This is a fake item!  I'd swallow it if this was from Apple.It is first time I got a fake item from\"fulfilled by Amazon\".Opened the box you will see only earphone box without real covering box and instructions book,also it has a very dirty,big sticker on it.\n",
      "Arrived yesterday. Volume controls and microphone didn't work. Returning\n",
      "Wow... I honestly have to say these are just terrible. I did a comparison between these earphones and the ones I got from the Apple store, and I have to say there is a BIG DIFFERENCE. These are definitely not like the originals.\n",
      "thanks for the complimentary ear wax also it smells like cologne and it's oily\n",
      "Not the real product. Go to Apple and buy them there. Lasted a week and the wire tore out from the pod. The sound was horrible compared to the pods I bought from the Apple store.\n",
      "I ordered 2 pairs and they both broke within two days each\n",
      "Bought these from seller Action Gear. It's hard to find genuine Apple-liscenced products online, but these are the real deal, am very happy with my purchase. Be careful from who you buy.\n",
      "Bought these and thought \"nice oem apple ear buds.\" I should have read the reviews. They look like em but quality sucks. They sound bad. The originals have no distortion turned up real loud, these do. The cords are too rigid - plastic feel, not rubber like the originals. Funny thing tho I paid 10.45 for these ear buds and when I click to leave feed back it says 3.57, and the ones I bought or thought I bought said by apple... not by e-xujing! I got ripped off! see attached screen shots. Supposedly i bought them from \"Just-One-Click\" and it was fulfilled by amazon. But now its not?it now its by E-XUJING and sold by LEACORE. I want a refund, i had to fight for it but i did get it.  False advertisement, and a Bait and switch went on here.\n",
      "Sound works great and is compatible with iPhone.\n",
      "I bought these back in 2013 and loved them every since.  The sound coming out of these buds are great, been working for me every since I bought them.\n",
      "NOT OEM...PURE JUNK and sound terrible.  took months to get as well!\n",
      "Terrible cheap, not worth the money.  Go to apple.com and pay $30 for the real thing.  These fell apart in a week.  The sound sucks, the earbud tops fell off...ugh..\n",
      "I have ordered this Earbuds and i am very disappointed after getting this order like...voice clarity is very very bad and even if we take the ear buds its just making noise like .if we put stones in empty box... totally i am unhappy with this order and also i don't have option to return the item.. So i suggest all to don't go for this product its worst worst worst..\n",
      "title says it all\n",
      "Great product, excellent service.\n",
      "These are the best headphones I have ever owned. The sound is unreal for the price point, and they simply do not fall out of my ears. I'm a runner, and I guess I have oddly shaped ears, because I have never found a pair of earbuds that will stay in my ears... until now.\n",
      "I detest the fact that Apple changed their headphones to this design. It has to be THE WORST performing/feeling pair of headphones i've ever owned. I would not recommend.\n",
      "All good thank you\n",
      "I have got two of these. One the left side didn't work, the second didn't work at all right out of the box\n",
      "I'm not sure what to say, because about 2 hrs before I got my package I read all the reviews and it didn't look too good. Some people got fake ones, some were broken, and I was worried mine would be the same. I got mine and they work perfectly fine, I don't see anything wrong with them, they don't look fake (not from what I can tell). I'm not sure if these people deliver cheap ones and sometimes real ones to get mixed reviews and save money. For me these are fine and worth the money I paid for it. For anyone skeptical then i would just buy it at a local store for just 10$ more. Based on other reviews I wouldn't trust this seller, but I got mine and they're perfectly fine. If you want to take the risk then go ahead. Maybe the other reviews are just trolls.\n",
      "Not made by Apple. The earbuds on mine completely fell apart within one week, and even when they were working, they sounded awful. Don't buy.\n",
      "Piece of junk! Very disappointed with these Ear pods. The left earphone stopped working 2 weeks after i received the product (which was 6 weeks after I ordered it) and last night the left earphone casing split open and the mechanism spilled out. I guess you do get what you pay for.\n",
      "my son has lost so many of these, when I order him some I get 2\n",
      "this product didn't even last a week. On the 3rd day the right side of the headphone stopped responding and the mic is terrible. The other party can barely hear what i am saying even when i am on the top of my voice\n",
      "Right here came broken.\n",
      "They are fake. The sound will hurt your ears after a short time and nothing sounds right in them.\n",
      "The ear uds are fine, but they are NOT OEM original Apple\n",
      "It did this weird thing where if you turned the mic piece, it would turn down the volume. And then the mic piece stopped working within a week. I can't use it to pause music, talk on the phone, etc. It still plays music fortunately. I'm a little disappointed with this product.\n",
      "HORRIBLE ONE DONT WORK I WASTED $25 DONT BUT THIS PEICE IF CRAP\n",
      "they are definitely not apple quality\n",
      "right ear bud stopped working after 2 uses.\n",
      "Good\n",
      "Perfect and marvelous deal!\n",
      "not original\n",
      "great .\n",
      "Came as described.\n",
      "My niece has some Apple Ear Phones and I could hear great with hers and they fit in my ear perfect.  These seem different.  They are still fine and sound good (not as loud as hers).  So....I really don't like to rate low....it's probably my fault for loving hers and maybe did not get the same ones.\n",
      "Not an authentic Apple product. The sound is not great.\n",
      "After a slow (6 weeks) boat from China, my 4 sets of earbuds arrived. Since then I have seen things I never have with real Apple earbuds, ear pieces coming apart, wires bad within days, overall they are junk. You get what you pay for, buy the real thing. NOT APPLE QUALITY!\n",
      "I ordered 2 of these and gave them to my wife. The mics on both did not work well at all. I ended up giving her my iPhone set and it worked for her. I tried one out on a conference call and no one could hear me. Looking very closely at the details of the set, it does not seem to be a real apple product. The markings for L, R and mic are not as dark as real apple product. Also very subtle differences in the texture of the ends of the wires.\n",
      "Guaranteed 1 day!\n",
      "Microphone part fell apart\n",
      "Great sound quality, but they are difficult to keep clean (with time).\n",
      "Love these...the sounds is great... strong... I've bought several pair ..\n",
      "Fake\n",
      "My son used it for a few month and then it broke.\n",
      "These are headphones. They work. But the sound quality is far worse than the headphones that originally came with my iPhone. I thought it was a good deal on headphones but it seems like these are merely a cheaper quality version of the normal iPhone headphones. I would not recommend these if you want them for music listening. Maybe if you just use them for podcast listening.\n",
      "crap product\n",
      "It was delivered on time, they work, and the price was good! All in all I'd recommend this product from this seller.\n",
      "I bought these recently to listen to music on my iPhone. They don't click into the jack like normal headphones do and so you have to hold them in place if you want the sound to go through them. I tried using them on my laptop as well to make sure it wasn't just something stuck in my jack, but i faced the same issue. Not sure if my headphones were just faulty or if it is poorly designed. I will be purchasing another pair from a different seller.\n",
      "Do not buy!  Fake do not work.\n",
      "Works just like it's supposed to! and can't beat the price.\n",
      "DON'T BUY!!!!  All 5 pairs that I bought for a vacation trip broke within a week of arriving.  I have never bother to write a review before but these earphones are SO bad that I felt compelled to share my experience.  I just can't believe these are genuine iPhone earphones.  Shameful.\n",
      "Well my wife lost my my i-phone ear buds that I lent her.\n",
      "I got it less than a week ago, and the microphone does not work, making it worse than no microphone. One of the earbuds has already started to come out.\n",
      "These are not original, the headphones are duplicate and we can't hear any sound\n",
      "Mine came with the right channel completely out. Throwing away.\n",
      "These don't work.  I waited 4 weeks for these to ship to me and the microphone doesn't work and the sound quality is shaky\n",
      "This s*** is FAKE!!! DO NOT BUY!!!\n",
      "Very high quality earphones. Only problem is that it should be priced at 20 dollars not 25. :D\n",
      "Whore out fast\n",
      "This is not a real apple earphone, it's a fake. Trust me, don't read the other reviews because this one is A FAKE!! The sound quality is horrible, I have no idea why it says apple sells it. If you want real apple earbuds go online directly to the apple store or go to the apple store. Don't buy this. The sound was horrible and the volume increase/decrease button didn't even work.\n",
      "Broke within a week.  Totally cheap.  I want to return it.\n",
      "There was ear wax on my headphones when newly open. Looks likes these are used before.\n",
      "The legit Apple earbuds. Had to replace my original pair after my cat chewed through it. Love them.\n",
      "It doesn't work,  fake\n",
      "Perfect\n",
      "it broke apart very soon\n",
      "Packaged well. Happy\n",
      "terrible quality\n",
      "Works well\n",
      "Warning - does not work under water.\n",
      "These are not good at all. I could see earwax on them before I opened them. I ordered them on July 19, the expected date was August 27, and it came on the first. Crap earbuds, and crap shipping.\n",
      "Worked for a long time\n",
      "These are definitely not an apple product.  Quality is very poor.  it was a waste of money.\n",
      "really good\n",
      "The microphone did not work...\n",
      "Same complaint as everyone else who was bought these: they're not actual apple headphones, and you can tell. I don't know how these guys can sell these with these claims, so just save yourself some trouble and don't buy these\n",
      "Perfect!\n",
      "Love The New Headphones , They Are Really Loud And Fashonable \n",
      "terrible quality! absolutely hate my iphone headphone! they hurt my ears, which in turn gives me a headache!\n",
      "works great\n",
      "Not good volume keeps going down\n",
      "Not genuine Apple product.  Don't sound as good as the originals.  Spend the extra money if you want good quality.\n",
      "Although the listing claims that it is an \"Original OEM iphone Earbuds,\" that is not accurate.  It is someone else's copy.  The earbuds aren't the same shape as the Apple earbuds, the sound quality isn't nearly as good as the Apple, and the controls are large, bulky, and don't work nearly as well.  Not recommended, and I'm returning them.\n",
      "Just can't believe they're \"Apple\" product! #1 They cost less than 6 bucks; #2 The Apple quality headphones are the best; #3 Once in a while the Amazon people get poor reviews for releasing bargains and people just can't believe their prices,or they don't like the quality.I'll trust this seller and others who \"Price War\" on Amazon.I bought two pair and both arrived the day after the other.I love the fit and quality!MEB2;8/29/2015;10:41am\n",
      "Nice\n",
      "I bought 3 pairs thinking they would be of good quality but to my dismay they were terrible. People could not hear me. And they hurt my ears. Gave my son a pair as he is on the road alot he hated them. Will not buy again.\n",
      "Don't buy these. If you have an iPhone, these earbuds messes with your volume and brightness. While I am jogging, it turns the volume all the way up or down. I couldn't figure out why. Could be the volume control attached to the ear buds.\n",
      "I thought this was from the Apple Company, but it wasn't. It came in a cheap-looking plastic box. Right then I knew this was a fake product. I tested it and the sound was off and in low quality.\n",
      "as promised\n",
      "This is just a piece of crap and it is not the orgianl Apple earpod, the biggest mistake i did was not reading the reviews before purchasing.\n",
      "excellent\n",
      "Headphones are fake broke after 2 days of use plus the sound quality was terrible.\n",
      "These EarPods are used. The wires are bumpy as if they were coiled and coiled of a long time. The case came in with a sealing sticker on the box, but the seal had already been pulled back.\n",
      "Amazing headphones! Definitely Apple quality. I have had them for 2 months now and i use them daily and they are still in perfect condition. will be purchasing again. fast shipping too.\n",
      "Delivered with defect. Mic not working. When listening to music - sound missing sometimes. Maybe cable damage. Do not buy from this seller. Many similar reviews found after buying.\n",
      "Perfect\n",
      "Broke after 2 uses, caps fell off earbuds. Worthless!\n",
      "They suck\n",
      "Great Product. Great Price.\n",
      "s***ty quality, dropped them on the floor... and they broke instantly!\n",
      "They were broken when I bought them\n",
      "The worst headphones ever!!! Right out of the box they sound like the speakers a blown. Don't believe the misrepresented description. They are not OEM, they are garbage.\n",
      "Fake Poor Quality, DO NOT BUY THIS\n",
      "Item arrived in time and was reasonably priced, but did not have the extra boost I was looking for.\n",
      "These are exactly what you would expect.  Another great apple product.  I am biased as an apple fan.\n",
      "Fits well. Sounds good.\n",
      "Good product for the money!\n",
      "I bought these a couple of months ago - and just tried to use them last weekend.  The left side gave me about 4 minutes of crackly sound and then completely went out.  Now I can't even return it, says Amazon, as the \"deadline\" was June 21st.  Super disappointed.\n",
      "fell apart within a week - cheap product\n",
      "Satisfied with the purchase\n",
      "Pathetic! Waste of money.\n",
      "This is not a Apple product! Seller is a liar.  Poor quality\n",
      "Excellent\n",
      "let me save you 7 dollars, the product takes a month to deliver then it breaks within two uses. I dont think its apple made.\n",
      "The best earbuds ever.  But everyone already knows this!\n",
      "Fake\n",
      "It's from Apple and worked as described. No problem here\n",
      "Great\n",
      "The worst headphone I ever purchased.\n",
      "If these aren't legit then they sure scammed me, because they are absolutely perfect!  The sound quality is as great as my original pair, they came in the expected Apple packaging, and after a couple months of abuse they're still in great condition!  Honestly, I can't believe these are so cheap-they go for nearly double in the store!\n",
      "Works perfectly.\n",
      "Very poor quality, its not good. never buy these\n",
      "Broke on arrival. Piece of junk.\n",
      "The headphones seemed like knockoffs as soon as I tried to take them out of the packaging. They were very difficult to get out of the plastic case without breaking them. I had to flex the case open in order to get the headphones out. I found the microphone and volume button very hard to press. I had to press it about four times harder than an original (real) set of headphones. Despite what the seller claims, these are definitely NOT OEM headphones. I should have known by the price...\n",
      "They are the same apple earbuds that come with and iphone and even same sound quality these earbuds are amazing would buy again\n",
      "Wasn't authentic at all. Mic doesn't work, the volume control only works one way. You get what you pay for\n",
      "Fits in my ears nicely and has great sound\n",
      "The mic and remote stopped working after one week. Not genuine Apple earbuds.\n",
      "It's a FAKE one. All parts are broken in the same day without any external impacts.\n",
      "Good sound\n",
      "These are hands down my favorite headphones!  I first tried a pair when I got an iPhone 6.  I ultimately returned that phone and subsequently the headphones.  I missed them so much, I had to get a pair.  I wear them everyday: listening to music at work, running, etc. They hold up well, provide great volume and audio quality and are super comfortable.\n",
      "Good\n",
      "The earpods are fake. They're not Apple, they stole from me.  I bought something thinking that i was going to have a nice earpods at a great price and it wasnt that way. As I salid,  they stole from me. Do no buy this product.\n",
      "Broke in under a week\n",
      "When I got these they were damaged\n",
      "Not real!!\n",
      "Good\n",
      "THEY DONT WORK!!!!!\n",
      "Took a while to ship and they were broken when I received them.\n",
      "Broke after the first month\n",
      "This earphone is fake, DO NOT BUY IT!\n",
      "Worked for one week then one earbud stopped working. Not what I was expecting.\n",
      "The headphones just completely sucked.. I \"accidentally \" dropped them BAM it came apart on one drop.. Im telling you.. Worst purchase.. Buy hey you get what you paid for..\n",
      "Fake! Not genuine apple product.\n",
      "Excellent sound and comfort.\n",
      "I ordered these earbuds\n",
      "Not original, terrible sound\n",
      "Very pleased\n",
      "They actually would be decent earbuds but for two huge problems; their fit, and the price. They don't have foam. They don't make any kind of seal, so sound escapes and is let in. The bass isn't bad, for cheap buds, and the highs are tinny but ok. The price is a TOTAL rip off. For this much you could find all kinds of good quality buds that sound and fit much better.\n",
      "Personally, it worked just as well as the earphones that come with the iPhone 5&6. I really recommend this product for anyone who needs a new pair.\n",
      "TOTALLY FAKE!!! I USED THEM FOR THE FORST TIME AND ONLY ONE OF THEM WORKED. YOU CAN TELL THEY ARE FAKE DUE TO THE CHEAP QUALITY. DO NOT BUY.\n",
      "This is not the real Apple product.\n",
      "I have ordered these Apple EarPods twice! I love the way they fit in each ear and it is so nice to\n",
      "I purchased these headphones and in a week they were broken. These are not genuine Apple Earbuds as they claim to be. They are 100% FAKE!!!!!!!\n",
      "These worked great. My daughter is not gentile. These are still working.\n",
      "Well. They lasted about three weeks. The earphones started coming apart. Pretty disappointing.\n",
      "Great\n",
      "Not as good as expected.\n",
      "This iPhone earbud set came packaged just like my original set in a sleek little plastic box.  They work just like my original set too.  The only difference I can see is that the cords are just slightly thinner.  I hope that this doesn't affect their durability, but so far they work  just fine.  Considering the price I paid, this was a good buy.\n",
      "These headphones are not apple products they are knock offs. The real headphones have inscripted serial no on them these do not.\n",
      "Works as expected,  but expensive APPLE product! Look at Other comparable earphones for much less...\n",
      "Works well.\n",
      "perfect!\n",
      "These headphones suck! straight out the box and i couldnot use them because the ppl i speak with on the other side all they hear is a loud noise.. i paid extra to make sure i had original earphones and these arent original because of the quality!\n",
      "Right ear peace was distorted from day one.\n",
      "Great sound but the mic and volume buttons don't work.\n",
      "I've had so many different pairs of these EarPods that I promise you, I couldn't count them on two hands. This product is spectacular - but only for a few months. I personally believe Apple makes them highly priced, perfect, yet very weak in the durability, for pure profit. It's upsetting because these headphones have so much potential if they had a better build quality that didn't degrade drastically over a period of months\n",
      "This product was horrible, I received it on a Friday and it  broke on a Sunday. I will never order from this company again!!!!!!\n",
      "I received an Original OEM iphone earbuds and working very well!\n",
      "Satified\n",
      "this is a scam. No is original and doesn't work. Very bad DO NOT BUY!!!!!!  AMAZON TEAM YOU NEED TO MAKE SOMETHING HERE>\n",
      "Do not buy! They stop working so fast and can tell are FAKE.\n",
      "My son uses these all the time.  Had them for a while and they have held up very well.\n",
      "Favorite headphones of all time. Delivered in on time and there like the best headphones ever\n",
      "Fell apart within a week, sound horrible.\n",
      "I obviously didn't read the description for this product. These were cheap Apple knock-offs.\n",
      "Not for iPhone 6 FYI but still works ok\n",
      "Great Product, Great Price. Was even delivered earlier than originally quoted. Awesome!\n",
      "When I first used them the microphone didn't work, but I was using a laptop, so I'll give them that. But a few days later the facade of plastic fell off the right side, and a few days later the the metal piece inside of the earbud fell out. Another few days later the right earbud stopped working entirely. Then of course the plastic facade of the left fell off. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS\n",
      "Not the original Apple earbuds, but they work fine for me.\n",
      "These are not Apple Earpods. They are very close but with a few mistakes. First, and the easiest mistake to not make, is that they messed up the box. Second, the 'Earpods' do not have the writing on the cord stating that the Earpods were designed by Appple in California.\n",
      "These are terrible, they are not original apple earpods they are fakes, you can tell by the TRRRS connector at the bottom.\n",
      "Thank you!\n",
      "The product is not like Iphone headphone set. The quality of the sound is far away from the original one. If you like music, dont buy it.\n",
      "Great headphones on time and in brand new package\n",
      "There not original there fake not worth it. ...not recommended still my money.....apple earbuds\n",
      "I like them so far there perfect even came in the apple box\n",
      "Do not buy these. They do not work as a microphone for the iphone.  They sound fine, but no one can hear me when I speak.\n",
      "Love these. Sure is an improvement over the old iPod earpods and fits in your ears just fine\n",
      "I love it , this is my second time buy it\n",
      "If you're lucky you'll have a pair that works. I bought 2 of them and only one pair works\n",
      "Looks not very new.\n",
      "I followed the advice of one of the reviewers that indicated that ordering directly from Amazon and not an independent seller would get me a genuine pair of Earpods.  Wrong.  The pair that came was a knockoff.  I bought it to replace a misplaced one and thank God the genuine pair was found.\n",
      "100% real work just like Apple ear pods\n",
      "Good earbuds, bought them as a present and have gotten no complaints.\n",
      "EXCELLENT\n",
      "fake apple earphone\n",
      "Fine, as expected.\n",
      "They are alright!\n",
      "I really didn't expect a whole lot when I purchased theses earbuds. (I bought them as a back up. I was surprised at how good they sound. No ear fatigue and a joy to listen to. It's also handy to use when I am driving.\n",
      "not happy with this purchase. The little cap on the ear bud continues to fall off on both sets.\n",
      "I bought several of these, for all of our electronic devices. I appreciate the fit into my ears. The sound quality is great, and easy to carry in a small area.\n",
      "This didn't work at all as a headset to talk on the phone. Everyone I tried to talk to using the headphones said they couldn't hear me. So i tried using them as just headphones to listen to music to and everything sounds like it's underwater. Don't waste your money.\n",
      "They broke weeks after using them. I do use them pretty much all day, every day, but still . . . it would be nice to get a couple of months of use out of them.  First the button stopped working, then one of the ear buds stopped working and finally, nothing worked.\n",
      "Husband loves the Earpods\n",
      "Fine product.\n",
      "the \"apple\" earpods are junk, they did not work and were obviously not actually made by apple. They weighed much less and did not feel nearly as solid\n",
      "FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE\n",
      "1st pair broke within 3 uses, returned and 2nd pair lasted a week-FAKE!!!!\n",
      "Has a pretty 'meh' quality. The product says it's from Apple, but the sound is a bit more tinny than the ones I got with my iPhone 6 at the Apple store. A few days ago I dropped them on a hardwood floor, and the flat part of the earbud that touches the inside of your ear fell off, but I could just pop that back on, so that wasn't a very big issue. One weird thing though- if they get electrically shocked, the shock goes straight up the cord and into your ear canal, which doesn't feel very good.\n",
      "Amazing!\n",
      "These busted the first day I used them\n",
      "Ordered a pair and only one ear worked so I asked for another pair and that pair was messed up as well. I had to rotate the plug in order to hear anything\n",
      "great\n",
      "Excelent stuff\n",
      "The inline mic/volume was not snapped together and will not close so it leaves electronics exposed. This does not seem like an authentic Apple product. Returned this and will spend the $29 at the Apple store for the real thing.\n",
      "Pros: Clear sound, good bass, comfortable, durable\n",
      "Horrible sound quality! They're not anything like the previous apple ear buds I owned that came with my phone. They came through the mail with the container broken!\n",
      "Not real Iphone earpods. I thought I was buying somee authentic earpods. Hopefully these last.\n",
      "Work GREAT! received in a timely manner :)\n",
      "Ive gone through a few pairs of these now and have yet to have one that works more than 3-4 months, its always the sounds control that breaks which is quite frustrating. Otherwise they are good headphones.\n",
      "Broke almost instantly. I'm not sure what happened as I usually have great success with Apple headphones lasting at least 2 years.\n",
      "Not actual Apple EarPods -- they do not work consistently\n",
      "Just as described. Good price fast shipping. It never hurts to have an extra pair around.\n",
      "Left ones don't work.\n",
      "Work good.\n",
      "They came late first of all. I waited nearly four weeks. Also they were broken. You can't hear music from the one of the two headphones. I was waiting them with so much excitement and I was really disappointed.\n",
      "These broke instantly after plugging them in to my iPhone.\n",
      "Amazing\n",
      "There not real apple earbuds and took 2 months to receive\n",
      "Yay\n",
      "Terrible, earpiece broke off. Product returned for refund.\n",
      "These are counterfeit.  They are not in Apple packaging and they don't sound nearly as good as Apple earbuds.  They are very nearly as expensive as genuine Apple.  They illegally use the Apple logo on the plastic holder.  Scam.\n",
      "It's faked.\n",
      "These are fake\n",
      "Came earlier then promised and works just fine.\n",
      "It doesn't look like same as my original earpod... at the end of the earpod line was tilted as well. but delivery was fast.\n",
      "They did not work after a few months.\n",
      "It's Apple brand, so they aren't the most durable, but I love the comfort and mic so I'll probably keep buying them.\n",
      "These are not the same headphones that came with my 5s. I recommend NOT buying these. Poor quality.\n",
      "It's a fraud. It doesn't work at all. I compared them with my originals buying with the iphone and they are similar but not originals. Just only they look like apple but they're not apple and they don't work.\n",
      "it is really true OEM one, I compared it with the one originally from my iphone6 and it's same, and good quality\n",
      "A low quality knockoff- I wish I would not have bought this product.\n",
      "These are not Apple headphones. Bought 2 pairs, both broke within days. Total waste of money.\n",
      "They work really good. When i first recievdd it though when the wire would be tugged it would shock my ear. I've had it for about 3-4 months now and they still work really great.\n",
      "Great\n",
      "After 1 week of purchase, left ear bud speaker is not working and cable got broken. Totally waste of purchase.\n",
      "These are pretty flippin awesome. I got the a while back and im still using them. They've stayed in great shape! Love these headphones!\n",
      "The apple buds fir my ears quite well and and have a much better low end than other brands I've tried. My only complaint would be the cord wears out we're it joins the plug. Which is whst happened to my last 2 sets.\n",
      "This  item was  broke\n",
      "Excellent.\n",
      "The item itself was great the shipping was great the overall experience was great! The only thing that I have is that the mic piece when I'm on a telephone conversation doesn't function properly I have to disconnect my headphones from my phone to continue with the call; but besides that it was a great experience and I thank you so much for your service\n",
      "Excellent product!\n",
      "Cheap wiring and plastic and awful sound quality. Returned them as soon as I could.\n",
      "It's Apple. I wish they made the ear buds Bluetooth.\n",
      "After a month the jack is falling apart.  I have never had this problem before with other apple earbuds.\n",
      "Pretty junky then again you get what you pay for\n",
      "Fake apple headphones\n",
      "These were not made by apple. Plus they didn't even work...at least amazon gave my money back. I guess.\n",

      "I purchased my headphones a little over a week ago and they have already broken. The left earbud has come out and it will not stay in place. It is useless now. Terrible product - very unsatisfied.\n",
      "dont last long\n",
      "Definitely lower quality than those directly from Apple.  They fell apart just a couple of weeks after I bought them.  Price is great but quality is not.\n",

      "Great buy work great!!!\n",
      "Went bad in less than a month\n",
      "These are most definitely NOT Apple genuine headphones. They are extremely flimsy and the sound quality is thin. This seller is an absolute scam and I would not recommend anyone to order these.\n",
      "broken within days. not only did they break physically, even before it broke the sound was terrible much much worse than regular iphone headphones. i need a refund or a replacement pair. the headphone covers came off, the wires opened up out of the white rubber casing and the right headphone doesn't even work.\n",
      "I do not feel that this were genuine. They literally fell apart after two weeks.\n",
      "Work great! Can hear clearly and recipient can hear me clearly.\n",
      "They are not the real ones. Very flimsy. Easily breakable.\n",
      "I thought that the EarPods came in a box like in The picture, but for the rest it was perfect\n",
      "Broke almost right away. Not worth it - don't waste your money!\n",

      "Good\n",
      "Love these headphones they fit my ear perfectly.\n",
      "not good  to many problem\n",

      "Good enough!\n",

      "They work and sound great for a bout a year, i've had to replace them twice.\n",
      "Great\n",
      "Not apple headphones . But they work and that's all that matters to me right now.\n",
      "These are counterfeit headphones.  They are styled and packaged to look like the Apple earbuds.  But they do not deliver the Apple sound quality.  Save your money and do not buy these.\n",
      "To start off, these aren't even 100% genuine OEM Apple EarPods. They lack bass and the sound quality is horrible. After one week of barely using them, the left side broke and only the right side was playing music. Getting my money back\n",
      "Anything but genuine and original. They have half the sound as my deceased real ones (rest in pieces) and are unbelievable flimsy. You'd be better off buying the completely over priced apple ones. Forget about using the crap mic as well because the thing is just terrible.\n",
      "sounds good.no problems.\n",
      "I ordered 2 of these at one time and 1 of them did not work.\n",
      "The description says it 100% genuine original OEM EarPods from Apple. Total knockoff. I tried using them but the sound quality is so bad it's in the trash. The external parts weren't even convincing. What a complete ripoff. Will never buy again.\n",
      "Exactly as shown\n",
      "Not good my ear phone https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41TgCcYkLgL._SS300_.jpg\n",
      "These are by far the best earbuds I have ever owned.  I've always tried others because they look cool but I always go back to these- they stay in my ears- have great sound.  As always Apple makes a great product.\n",
      "Definitely NOT Apple headphones.\n",
      "Betters than I expected and priced right.\n",
      "Quality sound! No external noises that are common to other cheap earphones. the new design of app earphones makes it easier for the user to wear the product. great!\n",
      "Sound quality is worth about as much as it cost. (What else could i expect) Comfortable fit tho.\n",
      "Can't go wrong with Apple products.\n",
      "This cannot be an apple product.... the mic is on the wrong side, you cannot hear anything.... Will be calling to send this back... I never return anything but this is very low quality.\n",
      "I'm not sure how they get to claim 100% Genuine Original OEM. They look close, but the cords are thinner and kink easier. The volume switch almost works. Oh well what can one expect for such a low price. I returned them successfully.\n",
      "what a great deal!!  Just what we needed after ours were lost..\n",
      "Aren't original, I compared them to original from Apple Store, but these are okay they're pretty loud.\n",
      "Not the real item.\n",
      "I had to return the first set they where broken and it took quite a while to get the second set\n",
      "There fake.  They don't stay in my ears and the sound quality is way worse then actual apple headphones.\n",
      "worst sound quality.\n",
      "The sound isn't perfect, but the microphone works better than most of the other headsets I have tried.  Great for the price.\n",
      "Headphones were not true iPhone 5. Last time ordering online\n",
      "I am a trustworthy, regular Amazon customer who has purchased different \"versions\" of these headphones plenty of times. You can take my word for it.\n",
      "These are not genuine/ authentic apple headphones there fake and the sound quality is terrible.\n",
      "They did not seem real at all, the wires were thin and cheap, they body cracked and both sides stopped working within 2 months of purchase.\n",
      "I read the comments before purchasing, but decided to buy them anyway. (I was desperate because my Iphone outgoing speaker is broken.) They seemed to be authentic; they had the apple serial number and such. The sound was amazing (but what do I know, I haven't had working headphones in months) Regardless, all the reviews are right. Somehow the right earbud stopped working, but the speaker part on the right side still works....Bizzar wiring I guess? Either way I knew this was going to be short lived. I got what I paid for.\n",
      "Nice\n",
      "Worked great for 2 days , then the left ear bud broke. Better off just buying from apple\n",
      "There is no base in them. They're very stiff. They seem to be fake!. It sounds like a speaker with no base!\n",
      "Do not purchase! I received these headphones for them to not work as a headpiece option when making calls. They worked for about two days as regular headphones. The second day I used them I heard static and that was it. Waste of money.\n",
      "Product does not work. How do I return.\n",
      "Cheap and not authentic! Do not buy.\n",
      "i recieved this, and mic was not working.\n",
      "Don't buy these. They broke the same day I received them.\n",
      "These are cheap knockoffs that fell apart the first day I owned them, and had poor sound quality in the few hours they worked.\n",
      "this product is genuine apple broke the first day sound quality poor.\n",
      "Mine had static first day and quit working. Looks are deceiving. They look like the real thing but don't be deceived\n",
      "very bad it's not Apple\n",
      "Bad headset\n",
      "Definitely not Apple (the cord is a lot flimsier), and the earphone with the microphone attachment plays sound a lot quieter.\n",
      "One word. FRAUD.\n",
      "Great for a hands free option\n",
      "Shipping took 5 weeks.  Fit and finish totally inferior to real apple EarPods that I have.  Sound poor, and volume button only worked down, not up.\n",
      "These broke in 3 days.\n",
      "Great product %100 satisfied\n",
      "These do not appears to be aunthentic apple products. They broke after a few days. The audio quality is very poor.\n",
      "Great headphones for a few days till the left EarPod stopped working.\n",
      "the ear buds are not very comfortable for small ears\n",
      "I bought this after my 3 year old pair of apple ear phones worn out that I mainly use during my workouts. It looks and feels very cheap. The bass response was not as good as I expected. I would stay away from this product.\n",

      "my daughter was happy with these, the sound quality was great .\n",
      "There are not Apple EarPods. The sound is awful in these. I have an actual Apple EarPods set I use at home and ordered this one for work, such a big difference. These are cheap and awful.\n",
      "These broke within a day.  I wonder about them actually being genuine apple products\n",
      "Headphones begin coming apart the day they arrived!! Also, sound quality is horrible...definitely not original Apple earbuds.\n",
      "One side broke after a month of regular use, slightly disappointed.\n",
      "Nice headphones but they have a cheap feeling to them and 1 headphone stopped working with in 3 days of use. I would suggest not buying this product.\n",
      "Not so good\n",
      "They took a long time to get here and only worked for 2 weeks. The sound just gone even though the previous day it seemed okay. This are by far the worse headphones I've had. Not because they are Apple headphones. The ones I used to have last a year, but these......not worth it. Buy it somewhere else\n",
      "Horrible sound quality.\n",

VERY VERY different from APPLE headphones, also it's very faint i had my iphone 1bar of volume and you absolutely hear NOTHING ! at least some white noises would be fine but NOTHING. Absolutely disappointed, If this is NOT being sold by Apple store then they should really stop because this is a piece of s***!\n",

And no Apple logo on the case it comes in. In other words: cheap Chinese (or Taiwanese) knockoffs!! Buyer beware. If you really want to save money, I guess they're ok, but if you're looking to replace your Apple headphones, don't even think of buying these!!\n",

      "After a quick comparison with real apple headphones these are nothing like them. Much less high end, muddy low end. It's possible these were rejects from apple, but it's more likely a knockoff copy. If you're ok with mediocre audio quality go for it, they're cheap. If you care about audio quality, consider spending a few more dollars.\n",

Within first month I dropped a pair and they broke.  I had my apple headphones many years and dropped many, many times and they never broke. I thought it was maybe a fluke but fast forward a couple months later and the 2nd pair are falling apart as well.  The remote on the wire, the volume/fastforward/rewind buttons are no longer working.  The cord shorts in and out of sound at times.

I did the following testings, and now I am confident that this is not the original OEM Apple iPhone 5s Earphones as advertised. This is a counterfeit product. 1. I borrowed my friend iPhone 5s Earphones that comes with her iPhone, and used the voice recording app to hear my own voice. My friend's Earphones recorded my voice very clear, and I can even hear my breath without pulling the mic close to my mouth. This product gave only a very vague voice recording, and if I don't put it right beside my mouth, I can hardly hear each of my words. 2. The control button of my friend's original iPhone 5s Earphones feels very soft, and it hardly gives out any sound when being pushed. And it can not be pried opened with my nails. This product's control button feels very hard, and it gives a dull clicking sound. This control button can also be easily pried open with my nails. 3. Since I could open the control button of this product. I compare the chip in it and the one I found on iFixit - iPhone 5 Earpods Tear Down*. The control chips look completely different and there are far less components in this product.\n",

      "These are just perfect.  I love them. They fit great, they sound great. Quality product!\n",
      "These are the worst earbuds I've ever used. They sound extremely distorted. The people I spoke to even stated they couldn't hear me well at all on their end. I gave up on them in 2 weeks and spent the money buying the real ones from Apple's website. I bought these hoping for a better deal while sacrificing on some of the quality, but these earbuds are complete garbage.\n",

Within 2 weeks of light use (e.g., on an airplane), the cord is already frayed at the socket, and the sound is inconsistent/spotty. Last straw was today when I attempted to go for a run with these and realized the cord is not long enough to even reach my shorts pocket, rendering the headphones useless when I run (which not at all a problem with my original iPhone headphones). If these are actually OEM, they are likely the rejects that did not meet Apple's quality standards. Will not be purchasing from them again.\n",

      "I bought two pairs of Apple EarPods and within 3 months both had broken with the same problem; i.e., no sound from one of the EarPods. So I thought they must have been fake. But, I did some research and both were authentic. Actually, I am not surprised. In the past, I purchased two IPods and they both broke easily. I will not buy any more products from Apple. I really do not understand how this company is so successful selling such fragile products.\n",
      "good purchase\n",
      "These things are solid! A solid piece of junk!\n",
      "These are TERRIBLE.  I love cheap products.  I buy them with the understanding that they're not going to last forever.  I bought these knowing that the sound quality would be inferior and that they may only last six months but I expected them to meet at least those expectations.  I just wanted a less expensive replacement for the REAL EarPods that came with my iPhone and I didn't want to go hunting at a store for some.  So I ignored the negative reviews, here.  Big mistake.  I couldn't use them AT ALL.  From the first use in my iPhone, the right side was out and the left side crackled loudly any time the cord moved at all.  Even at full volume, you could barely hear the audio book I was listening to.  I should have gone to Best Buy and bought some sale priced Skull Candy ones instead.  NO NOT BUY.\n",

      "To being with I do not understand why they have the apple logo on them. This is false advertising and I am surprised that they have not run into legal troubles. Second of all, the microphone never worked in mine. I can still get sound in my ears so I ended up using them for listening to music at work. I never used them for the purpose I wanted them (ie as handsfree)\n",

      "These are NOT genuine Apple EarPods.  The pictures listed in the description are misleading as the product was delivered in a generic plastic case with no Apple insignia.  The cord is 6-8 inches shorter and are narrower than the genuine Apple EarPods.  The volume control did not work properly and was of noticeably poor quality.  Overall these are generic ear-buds that are designed to look at first glance like a superior Apple product.\n",
      "Got these in the mail today and plugged them into my computer only to find that they arrived damaged. Only the left earphone works. I won't be buying headphones from Apple again.\n",

      "So Far So Good. Just got them. Have the apple logo on the back. They are loud and arrived way before the estimated time to get here. Can't always go buy the negative comments.\n",
      "Worst ever. One of the earpiece failed within 3days. These are refurbished i guess. dont recommend\n",

      "Its actaully what i wanted and payed for. Unlike my other head phones, these ones have actually lasted almost a year. It's worth buying namebrand instead of buying those cheap ones that only last like two months before going out.\n",
      "Great! Just like the ones that came with the phone.\n",
      "Excellent. As always Apple products.\n",
      "Can be a little hard on the ears and tend to fall out, as they are just hard plastic.  They do have good sound quality.\n",
      "These are just like the original.  Highly recommend!\n",
      "Isn't exactly an apple product, cause the tone isn't the same. I've been told by people when I'm speaking with them that they hear a cracking sound, which I'm not hearing, but they are. The quality is good, but I had to go back to using my old apple earbuds as I couldn't stand hearing so many complaints from everyone.\n",

From my initial use the caller on the other end said there was a popping, crackling static type sound heard. Once I remove the headset the noise went away. Now this was during the initial use...first first use and there's a problem. Once the issue persisted I put them in my junk draw. Waste of time and money....not to mention there was a chip on the earpiece...hidden at first sight because of the way it was packaged. It is certainly an under statement to say I was dissatisifed.

Depending on how the headphones are positioned depends on how well they will work.  Sometimes the right earbud completely goes out!  Sometimes there's a ringing sound in the left earbud.  These are NOT Apple headphones!!\n",

      "I've been using these for hours a day every day for about 5 months, and they're still in great shape.\n",
      "replaced my prior pair that was eaten by my dog ... great sound ... got them fast ...\n",
      "I love it ^_^\n",
      "the item worked for few weeks and then one of the speaker stopped working.  Delivery was on time.\n",
      "Got these and they didn't work. At all. Definitely don't buy them.\n",
      "cant tell the difference from the OEM ones. I like them.\n",
      "Looks like the real thing (almost), but is NOT the real thing--a knock-off. The sound quality is very poor compared to actual original Apple product.\n",
      "Okay\n",
      "FAKE!!\n",
      "The microphone does not work.\n",
      "Worked fine, while it worked. Plug \"turtled\" and quit working after 5 months.\n",
      "Great headphones!\n",
      "They only worked for 1 day and then the next day the left ear piece has NO sound. Extremely disappointed!  However for the very short time they did work, they worked well.\n",
      "These ear buds are not Apple OEM.  They are not made with the same quality of materials.  The sound does not appear to be different, but the microphone hole is missing in the remote area, so the ability to hear what I say is not quite as good..  The build quality seems similar, but the quality of the wire covering is not at the same as the OEM ear buds.  It is a slick, thinner covering.  On the positive side, they do not tangle as badly.  I have only had them for a week, so the durability is unknown.\n",
      "useful\n",
      "These are counterfeit Apple headphones.\n",
      "I've had these ear pods once before as a gift and I absolutely love them.  I love the way they fit in my ears and the sound quality is great.\n",
      "The microphone doesn't work\n",
      "Crappiest EarPods ever! Broke the first time I used them! Total pieces of crap. Don't waste your money on this fake crap.\n",
      "Product as promised.\n",
      "I left my former headphone home so I bought two of these early this year. I just used them normally as all my other headphone but they all died now. I doubt they are new or even really from apple because the front part of this headphone can be turned all the way around. Very disappointed.\n",
      "excellent\n",
      "Working well\n",
      "I really like these, and prefer them over any other earpod/headphones, etc. But they keep ripping on me, plus theyre quite expensive..\n",
      "Broke The Next Day !!\n",
      "These earbuds sound great. The biggest surprise was when my husband left them in his jeans pocket when he threw them in the laundry. They came through the front-loader washer and dryer and still worked perfectly.\n",
      "Fake\n",
      "Very good earbuds. I'm not even that big of an Apple fan, but these are the best earbuds I've ever heard and I'm on my fourth pair of them. The bass and highs sound great with a wide range. And they look good also. Couldn't be happier with them.\n",
      "Either they are knock offs or these are just junk\n",
      "Is just want I looking for really good\n",
      "Do not buy!!! Cheap, cheap, cheap!! NOT real Apple headphones. Horrible sound quality, terrible microphone. I'm so disappointed. I wish I could return. Lesson learned. I will now be buying all my Apple product in-store or on Apple website directly.\n",
      "Seems to be the original earphones\n",
      "Thanks\n",
      "These are the real apple earpods and they work perfectly\n",
      "They worked for a day then the right side never worked again. They are fake and not an apple product.\n",
      "I bought these a year ago and they never fell apart on me. I'm not too sure if these were actual apple earpods, but they sounded great. I slept with them every night since i got them, and they stayed intact. Nothing happened to them, until the wire started messing up and the mic stopped working, but I blamed myself for that since I did sleep with them every night. They lasted a good while, about 7 months. I'd probably buy these again once they go back to being around $10-$15.\n",
      "very good product!\n",
      "Great headphones, nice bass\n",
      "the remote and microphone are useless, did not work at all. the earbud cover kept falling off and after a few more weeks, the wiring in one earbud broke off completely. i know these arent geniune Apple earbuds, but even i didnt expect these to last me only a month\n",
      "I give them  only 4 stars  because  the old version was made to last longer\n",
      "Flawless, worked perfectly.\n",
      "lol do not buy this i just used it for one day and stoped working\n",
      "Unfortunately these fell apart within the first two weeks I had them, and I didn't even use them often. I was truly disappointed!\n",
      "I think they are fake,,,sounds good but volume is low\n",
      "Arrival was quick, but the right side earphone quickly shorted out.\n",
      "THEY ARE REAL APPLE HEADPHONES! for all you skeptical buyers like me\n",
      "I really love the sound. I wish Apple would make a wireless bluetooth version for athletes.\n",
      "Just OKAY headphones. I honestly hate Apple for selling overpriced s***. This is the 4th pair of apple earbuds I've gone through. The design of the earbuds are very poor, and break easily. Aside from that, the audio is pretty good. The only reason you pay so much is that it's an \"Apple\" product. I'd personally recommend anyone to buy some other brand before you get this one..\n",
      "Best headphones I have ever bought. Last long and fit great in my awkward ears.\n",
      "Terrible.\n",
      "Works Great!!!\n",
      "A perfect product to buy. I'm highly impressed\n",
      "Acutely it's not so good withe calling, because when I call my friends by the headphone they can't hear me clearly.\n",
      "sound is horrible\n",
      "This item is just dreadful, and hurts my ears whenever I put\n",
      "I loved the pair of earbuds I got with my iPhone 5.  They weren't flashy or dole out especially high quality sound, but they were good, solid, and reliable.  I got this when I stressed the wires on my first pair a little too much and it was a completely different quality.  The screens on the earbuds fell out within a couple months, the hands-free mic sounds muffled and distant to those on the other end of the call, and the rubber around the cord has already frayed.  Overall, I'm very disappointed and not sure whether to flip a coin and try another pair or upgrade.\n",
      "The Apple EarPods are a great improvement over the last headphones Apple made. The earphones are a middle class headphone with a bigger brother for around $80. Overall I think these headphones are great and would recommend it to friends and family that are looking for descent earphones.\n",
      "Two weeks after receiving them, the ear piece fell out and the wire split in half. Very low quality\n",
      "Not Apple earpods, they're a knockoff which is expected with this price.  The first pair I ordered would only play out of one ear so I returned and got another pair that plays out of both ears but is poor quality.  The return process was smooth, liked the seller, but the product isn't great.\n",
      "I bought these from the seller Tronix and they seem to be legit apple OEM ear buds. At least they sound great and just like the ones I had before.\n",
      "better than regular buds!\n",
      "only left bud worked.\n",
      "These things suck!! They were broken upon arrival and the button feels junky. Don't be fooled; this is not the real deal.  You're better off paying full price for the Apple ones- at least they'll work!\n",
      "Bab bad .\n",
      "I tried returning this and it was not an apple product. The seller never got back to me and these headphones fell apart in my ear. I was sitting down doing office work and I received a shock and my headphone fell apart. Do not buy... Just go on Apple.com instead it's the same price and you never know when you might get a fake product. Sound quality was really bad as well. Everything was faint from start to finish.\n",
      "These are real earbuds. If you like apple earbuds, these are them. If you don't mind getting shocked in your ears a couple times every winter, step right up.\n",
      "Good!\n",
      "The volume down button doesn't work :/ but other than that, they're really nice.\n",
      "Don't buy these.  They are so cheap they did not last but a few weeks.  They must be defects or counterfeits.\n",
      "They're the real deal, folks.\n",
      "When I first purchased these, they worked just fine.  Now, after having used them for a while, I can't seem to get them to sit properly in my ears, which prevents me from hearing everything that I insist on hearing when listening to music or videos.  The SkullCandy earphones I had previously were much, much better, and worth the price.\n",
      "Still on the quest to find headphones that last more than a week or two..\n",
      "lasted about two weeks\n",
      "brocken in two weeks\n",
      "Love these  they are so comfortable!!!\n",
      "A good product, works as well as the original.\n",
      "It's an Apple product...speaks for itself\n",
      "Perfect! Thank you!\n",
      "These are perfect -- I use them for all cell calls -- and conference calls on my think pad for work.  Really clear...never a problem.\n",
      "Stopped working after a few weeks of moderate use. I think it's something in the remote buttons as it started pausing and playing randomly leading up to not working at all\n",
      "Perfect!\n",
      "These earpods broke within 2 weeks of using them; within 1 week the \"L\" for left rubbed off.  I don't recommend them.  I wound up returning them and coughing up the money and paying regular price at the Apple store and I'm glad I did.\n",
      "did not  hold up well to be apple product\n",
      "Broke and stopped working in a week\n",
      "These were not the same as the ones I received with my iPhone 5s. I was disappointed because they were bigger and hurt my ears\n",
      "Great earpods Very happy with the item .\n",
      "I haven't met anyone who thinks these are comfortable, but they might work for you.\n",
      "I Like It\n",
      "I love the Apple EarPods. They are comfortable in the ear and they sounds great with nice bass. :D The addition mic and volume and pause/play control is nice too!! The extra features (mic, volume buttons, pause/play) may not work on Androids or Windows, but they work great on iPhones and Macs!\n",
      "Fake apple earphones! Wouldn't buy from here!!!\n",
      "Fake fake fake fake product :[\n",
      "These ear buds are pretty expensive for the price. The shape is alot better than the previous Apple Ear buds but you can find much better much cheaper Ear buds online and in stores.\n",
      "Awesome\n",
      "They stopped working 2 months ago Poor Quality . I decide to buy OEM from apple  what a difference\n",
      "I like them. They are as described. The delivery was on time.\n",
      "Excellent\n",
      "Worked fine for a couple months. The remote was the first thing to die. Now only the left earpod works.\n",
      "excellent product\n",
      "It's what you would expect, a pair of ear-pods.\n",
      "Works great thank you\n",
      "Can't beat the quality for the price.\n",
      "Got these dirt cheap, but the in-line mic is shot.  Fine for listening to music, but don't expect to talk on them.\n",
      "excellent product\n",
      "not apple - took to apple store and compared and NOT the same -\n",
      "I'm not a fan of Apple and I don't really care for iPhones, I'm more of an Android enthusiast but I gotta give Apple credit they make wonderful sounding headphones.\n",
      "These earphones were broke when I received them.  I should have returned them but got caught up in some family issues, put these earphones lower on my priority list, put it aside and forgot about It.  I don't normally write reviews, but just bought Bluetooth speaker from amazon and it to did not work, waiting for label from amazon now to return this speaker.  I am a long time member of amazon, made many purxhases, but in my experience with any type of electronics-  I will no longer order any type of electronics from amazon, unfortunate for Amazon because I have 11 grandchildren and  purchase a lot of electronics.\n",
      "Thank you  for your kindness was very happy with  my order.\n",
      "They worked perfectly! I love them\n",
      "Great sound quality, comfortable and nice in general. However, I listen to music at the gym and they pop out a lot sometimes if I am moving my torso a lot. Either way, still nice.\n",
      "Good\n",
      "THE BEST ear plugs I've ever used!\n",
      "Good\n",
      "One ear bud broke with normal use after less than 4 months.  Now I cannot return...\n",
      "Control button doesn't always work.\n",
      "i dropped it a couple times & one of the pieces kept coming out, which broke slightly. it's nice if you need a quick spare pair of headphones if you accidently leave yours @ home or something. just basic. the sound was clear though. that was nice.\n",
      "good\n",
      "they seemd great at first but are not lasting. they are too expensive for such a small amount of quality :(\n",
      "Great product A+\n",
      "The part you plug into your phone broke right off after about 3 weeks. Went to an Apple Store and bought legit earbuds instead of dealing with any more of these.\n",
      "Perfect\n",
      "Absolute CRAP- Don't buy these- people can't hear you when on a call and the sound quality is horrible on your end too- cheap - horrible knockoffs.  Pay the extra $10 bucks now to buy the real apple headphones OR end up paying $50 (20$ for this ripoff +$30 for apple ones) at the end of it all.\n",
      "I lost my original apple earbuds so I got this one :)\n",
      "Not apples OME earphones, they work, but there still not apple ones.\n",
      "Don't buy hate the sound last a couple months.\n",
      "Pros: sounds better & easier on the ears\n",
      "Exactly what I wanted!!\n",
      "fake\n",
      "The best earphones ever for few dollars.\n",
      "I have always loved my Pods!\n",
      "They are already broken\n",
      "Works great..,\n",
      "They are good--while they last. I've purchased these at least 3 times within the past year and they don't last long. The buds break apart, they lose sound in one ear, and they just crap out after a few months.\n",
      "i love it\n",
      "Fits great.\n",
      "I don't know if it was my fault or not but the right earphone broke just a couple of weeks after I got it. But other than that they're alright and it's nice to have headphones but it sucks that I have to buy a new pair already...\n",
      "Always amazed how good these are after wearing other decent headphones. Not disappointing.\n",
      "Too short! will not recommend it.\n",
      "If they are not original ... they surely look and feel like original. Great product. Very happy with them.\n",
      "very best!!!!!\n",
      "fits the iPhone and does what they're supposed to do.\n",
      "Excellent!! Great Price!! Use them for the gym 5 days a week and sound and microphone work great.\n",
      "I like these and the sound is very good for the price. They don't quite sink in far enough, especially in my right ear, and they do fall out several times until they get seated during my jogs. They work best when wearing a pull over cap that holds them in the ears.\n",
      "Sound is good, not the most comfortable to wear for long periods.\n",
      "the mic broke and one ear came apart the same day i got them in the mail do not order from this buyer\n",
      "perfectttttt.... BUY you can trust it\n",
      "This was very cheap quality. The buds honestly rattled in my hands because they were so poorly made. The only good thing about this was that I got my money back.\n",
      "Nice!\n",
      "They work great. I have never had a problem with them at all.\n",
      "So I had these earbuds for roughly 7 or 8 months now and I bought them here on Amazon and up until now I can tell you these are so worth the money. I really enjoy the clear quality they bring out to the music I listen to, they are super comfortable and will not fall out of your ears unless the cord hangs onto something wich can be super annoying at times.\n",
      "Bought these for my daughter she is very happy with them-I told her to take good care of them and she has by not twisting the cord\n",
      "Headphones are clearly fake.  The wire is thin and the earbuds lack weight.  This is unfortunate since I use them to run and the earbuds keep popping out of my ear.\n",
      "Good bass and good backups if you have better ones.\n",
      "Horrible. Broke within the first week. Definitely not authentic\n",
      "I had a lot of earphones in my life these right there are thebest ones ssimply due to the sound being amazing. It's just amazing earphones\n",
      "This is not original apple earbuds it's fake\n",
      "Great ear buds and great price how would you do better\n",
      "Does what it says on the tin\n",
      "Sheathing pulled back from head phone jack, mic, and left head phone. Mic didn't work, button function (except for volume up) was no good. Junk. didnt bother returning. If the company is being disengenuos enough to say they're an Apple product, I'm not interested in continuing business with them.\n",
      "Didn't work well wouldn't buy it again\n",
      "The headphones have great sound quality and are Apple headphones. The price was also great since at a regular store they cost from $30 and up.\n",
      "good product. holds up well. A+++\n",
      "Expected apple product quality but my expectations weren't met. I have these for my backup headphones but the cord feels cheap and when I skyped my friend, she said my mic sounded like it was in a tunnel.\n",
      "Good sound, but super unconfortable, makes my ears hurt after using.....\n",
      "Definitely the real deal!\n",
      "Love these, the sound is clear, there's good bass and they don't hurt my ears so they're perfect for me!\n",
      "my 13 year old loves these\n",
      "Did not work at all. Total waste of money.\n",
      "Sound quality lasted for like a week and then people had a hard time hearing me. 2nd pair with the same issue.\n",
      "Definitely worth it. Best earphones ever\n",
      "Cheap!!!! They broke in a couple of days\n",
      "THE BESTTTTT\n",
      "best pair of headphones ive had\n",
      "Only worked for 10 days then the left one stopped workin!\n",
      "Daughter loves them!\n",
      "I got these awhile back and I'm still using them.  They work great.\n",
      "Little size, BIG punch. Love how comfortable these are. I know own 2 sets. I use them for PC gaming and can hear very good sound from enemies on the game Counterstrike. I am able to play at a top level with these just fine. Music they work great too.\n",
      "Not original apple earbuds. Withen a week the ends are exposing wires and I had to close it with electrical tape. Two days of use and it stared cutting out. The sound quality is awful. Take my advice; if you want the original earpods go to the apple website to purchase. Don't waist money on these.\n",
      "They broke really fast loved them but cheap and wouldn't exchange them.\n",
      "Use all the time, everyday.\n",
      "nice earpods which I use for my laptop!\n",
      "GOOD!\n",
      "Good ear pods. I really like it!\n",
      "Very good\n",
      "good.\n",
      "Not real apple earphone. Bad quality.\n",
      "This is a pretty good deal for a decent pair of earbuds.\n",
      "These are by far the best head phones/ear pods i have ever owned! Highly recommended! Especially  to those who have had problems finding ear phones that just never fit or fall out constantly :-)\n",
      "There was a short in the wire from the day I received it.\n",
      "Doing the job as what it is\n",
      "They lasted me a little over 2 weeks before one of the earpods (the right one) stopped working out of the blue. The earpods do not have much bass whatsoever. I made sure of this after hearing earpods that came with an iPhone.\n",
      "Awesome quality\n",
      "Great\n",
      "They are ear buds - what can I say.  I use them on my iPod to listen to music and story books.  I like them because I can turn the volume up and down or pause the story book without turning on my iPod.\n",
      "great product\n",
      "delivered without issue Jan27. right side dead by mar7. recommend that you skip these\n",
      "They were not great quality hearing wise. Makes a buzzing noise in earbuds and static noise as well.\n",
      "Cracked after about a year of use.\n",
      "Stopped working after 11 months of light usage. My original Apple earpods lasted almost 5 years. I emailed the seller with my problem, and tried to work something out, but they told me, \"We cannot accept return at this time as we offer a 30 day return\". Nothing else, no attempt to make the problem right. So if you buy from them, and the product stops working after more than a month, you're out of luck. Good riddance.\n",
      "I think they were pretty good headphones. Except they shocked me a couple times and I was afraid to use them for a couple days. Other than that, they were good headphones.\n",
      "Just like the headphones that come with the phone\n",
      "Poor sound quality compared to the real thing. Don't fool yourself, this is not a genuine apple product.\n",
      "It was a. Gift, the person loved them\n",
      "Absolutely Garbage.\n",
      "92 days after purchase  (almost exactly) the controls for music and phone stopped working. They do not accept requests for help after 90 days.\n",
      "Great Earbuds.  Mic works perfectly and clear on my conference calls both on my iPhone and my MacBook.\n",
      "I just got these and it came with ear wax in them and only the right one worked. If you want to get Apple Earpods, get the real thing.\n",
      "I doubt that these are real apple ear pods even though they are marketed as such. I had the product a total of 3 weeks before they stopped completely. I sit behind a desk all day and primarily use them as hands free communication for phone calls so they get light use. The wire going into the left ear pod was always loose and required it to be pushed up fully into the ear pod to work. The right side just stopped working a few days ago. The quality is very poor in sound and durability compared to the original ear pods I received with my phone 3 years ago which lasted 3 years. I do not recommend this product.\n",
      "Excellent product\n",
      "Gotten on time & work perfectly.\n",
      "Great product. Just wish it wasn't so expensive!\n",
      "Very good\n",
      "good sound, doesn't hurt ears\n",
      "Very poor ear buds, not genuine Apple buds....rip off!!!\n",
      "Yes, this is an apple earpods refurbished, but\n",
      "These were a knockoff. The left earbud fell apart in less than three weeks. DO NOT BUY\n",
      "Great sound, long lasting\n",
      "works great. much cheaper than in Walmart.\n",
      "OK\n",
      "Horrible, tinker-toy sound.  To add insult to injury there was no sound coming from one ear after about 2 weeks of owning these. I'm not sure why anyone would give this product high marks.  You've been warned.\n",
      "I like this new design. It fits in my ears. I use it mainly while running and it stays there all the run.\n",
      "These headphones are not sweat resistant,they are not good to workout with at all.i have a pair and they are dying because of sweat.\n",
      "As expected.\n",
      "Surround sound is great.\n",
      "Fake they don't sound as terrible as other fake ones I've encountered, but at $20 I was very disappointed.\n",
      "The remote and mic did not work:( I had to send it back.\n",
      "Excelente\n",
      "Within the first use of the EarPods the left side did not play sound at all. I contacted the seller last Tuesday or Wednesday to exchange this pair for a working pair. The seller has yet to respond in a week.\n",
      "Right earpod got real silent and I can barely hear out of it but other than that they work fine.\n",
      "Decent quality but the plastic broke very quickly.\n",
      "Definitely not apple product. Quality is low, but the price is low. You pay what  you get for.\n",
      "Great price and super fast shipping.\n",
      "Great Itrem Excellent\n",
      "I got little adapter things that go over the buds for Christmas so I needed ear buds to put in them. The combo is solid and stays in my ears during workouts.\n",
      "Really good. and original product\n",
      "Right speaker blown when received. IF this is an actual Apple product, it’s a factory reject.\n",
      "Do not last very long.\n",
      "I hav used it for a month already.. So far no complaints:)\n",
      "Low quality Apple fakes\n",
      "Excellent\n",
      "They were ok. But item already broke\n",
      "They broke within the first 2 weeks\n",
      "Good quality\n",
      "It didn't last so I wonder if this was really a true Apple product.  I suspect it was a knockoff.\n",
      "Hey guys, idk what everyone is talking about saying they are fake but i got these about a week ago and they are just amazing, they are incredible for any type of music! They are 100% apple earpods, i was able to compare them to the earpods of my iphone 5 which came along with the phone and they sound, feel, look, and work exactly the same these are legit earpods i dont know what everyone is talking about saying these are fake...but i assure you they are authentic so dont be scared to buy them they are great!\n",
      "Good quality as though you bought it from the Apple store.\n",
      "I have original apple earphone that came with my iphone6. This earphone's quality is very bad compared to the earphone that i have. When I talk on the phone, the person who I talk to have hard time listening to me. And left side of the earphone volume is lower than the right side. I really regret that I bought this earphone. I should have just bought it at the apple store.\n",
      "FAKE. Decent looking knock-offs but the sound was terrible. Wish i had read reviews before purchasing. Returned them the next day after arrival. False advertising of products should result in a ban from amazon.\n",
      "Counterfeit and not apple\n",
      "Not sure if this are real.i give it 3 stars because I can hear music pretty good, but when I make a phone call people have a hard time hearing me , so the mic you talk into sucks\n",
      "Very good\n",
      "Great\n",
      "Excelent product\n",
      "Sound quality wasn't as good. The buttons on the remote were difficult to push.\n",
      "They do the job. They don't seem to fit the same way my EarPods that came with my iPhone. So it makes me think they aren't authentic. Oh well, they were cheaper than the ones in the store.\n",
      "Good\n",
      "Great\n",
      "These headphones are ok, I would like a little more power in the bass department as there are cheaper headphones with better sound. The extra features of the headphones (microphone and volume control) are pretty useful though.\n",
      "i will like to buy it again. i recommend this product to any one. the sound are really good\n",
      "Don't buy these. Seriously. Very cheap quality\n",
      "These do not work!\n",
      "i have my doubts about whether these are in fact apple devices. speakers rattle in the housings and the housings come apart.\n",
      "Best headphones among the products of the same size. It rest comfortably at my ear. The designer really gives some thought into its design. After all, it's the most practical not the most seemingly smart design that may last longer on your ears.\n",
      "Perfect quality\n",
      "Great product promptly delivered.\n",
      "I decided to buy a new pair of Apple earpods. Since I busted my original earphones, I've been jumping in and out of compatible brands only to see them broken after a few weeks, 2 months at the most. Well now I can say I have a reliable pair. I've had it for almost 8 months and it's still working fine.\n",
      "It came on time & it was what I expected\n",
      "Works great.  I even figured out how to put it back the way it came, but that is too time involved so I bought a little plastic box to put it in when I'm not using it.\n",
      "Excelente\n",
      "You can definitely tell these are fake because the box doesn't even have the Apple logo on the back. The sound quality is absolutely terrible and fake. Apple earpods are made with a different length. It is impossible to get them back in the box. Definitely not what I was expecting and I wish I never bought them. I've only had these earpods for one day and they are awful.\n",
      "fake item!\n",
      "Work great. Exactly what I ordered.\n",
      "I heard them really good but then in just a couple of weeks they broke.\n",
      "These aren't Apple headphones. You should probably remove them from your inventory before anyone else loses their money in them.\n",
      "I bought these headphones to use as a hands-free device while talking on my iPhone.  They work perfectly!  I really like the shape of the Apple EarPods.  They fit in my ears nicely and actually stay in.  I had previously been using the old Apple earphones with mic, so upgrading to the EarPods with mic has been a nice treat.  They work well for me.\n",
      "Exactly like the earpods that come with an iPhone or iPod. I lost my previous pair and wanted to replace them. They work perfectly!\n",
      "original apple great\n",
      "FAKE. super low quality. I feel ripped off.\n",
      "It does the job for the price. If you're willing to spend money, get the real ones from apple.com\n",
      "it is a fake product, don't buy it. this earpods is not apple product, the sound quality is very bad, and i don't know why there are lots of people give this item 5 star review.\n",
      "When I recieved my EarPods I noticed that they were not authentic, then I tried them and noticed that only one side worked, and the sound quality was very poor, I would not recommend these\n",
      "These earbuds broke within 48 hrs of receiving them. They did not appear to be able quality.\n",
      "Perfect\n",
      "not met my expectations, is heard on one side and the other not, sorry but it's true, who had sent me problems\n",
      "Mediocre quality, nothing compared to what you get when purchasing a new Apple product.\n",
      "actually apple - not a terribly made quasi not functional chinese knockoff, the real thing and it makes a big difference.\n",
      "On time, good price.\n",
      "nice good quality!\n",
      "Not sure if they a \"real\" apple products, but they fit and sound the same.\n",
      "Good earbuds just the sound was off\n",
      "They arrived on time and were perfect..... at first.  The left ear blew out after a month and the right ones going too. Waiting to see if they will let me return them.\n",
      "Worked perfectly!\n",
      "Were not made well at all\n",
      "My sisters have these and whenever They listen to music they don't fall out of there ear. I've always wanted a pair of beats but I tryed these they where the best EARPHONES EVER\n",
      "My son loved them\n",
      "These are the right product, but the audio jack was bent for me.\n",
      "these are in no way true Apple ear pods they broke in less than a week!\n",
      "Although I never received my earbuds for this order or even heard back from the seller trendz after 3 inquiries, I can comment on these earbuds because I had bought some previously. These are well built Apple earbuds that fit well in my ear. The sound is very good for earbuds in this price range.\n",
      "These were about 50% as effective as the original Apple ones on my phone this is my experience may not be other peoples experience but I was asked to share my experience and here it is\n",
      "The product is apple ear pod, and is defective! I have been using apple ear pods since 2008.\n",
      "Bought this for my boyfriend and he likes how it fits comfortably in his ears. I have a pair too and it's really nice!\n",
      "nice love them\n",
      "It seriously broke three months after I got it. Unlike the LAST generation which I'm forced to use now, this does feel WAY more comfortable but UNLIKE last generation they can't stand the test of time like all other Apple products these days. -Personally I have a Windows Phone, PC, and Xboxs- the worst part was I got them new just to break on me.\n",
      "Questionable but expected quality. Besides the fact that they probably will not last more than a few months, the volume and music control buttons are somewhat hard to press. Important to note that these are NOT authentic apple earphones. Half the price of real apple earphones, but probably 75% of the quality is there.\n",
      "I ordered two of these, and both are absolute garbage. These knockoffs fell apart the first time I tried using them!\n",
      "\n",
      "Worst quality headphones I have ever purchased in my life\n",
      "They work just as I expected thank you\n",
      "The kids love these\n",
      "Excellent\n",
      "The sound quality is as expected for this price and feels as good as originals\n",
      "The mic didn't work!\n",
      "These are my favorite pair of ear buds. I have gone through a few sets over the past few months. Very easy to use and I love the remote to control the music volume when I am at the gym.\n",
      "Best wired earphones with mic I've owned\n",
      "Was a bit hesitant when I saw some comments saying that they are fake. But, they are genuine apple products and they work super fine with my i-Phone.\n",
      "Had to get mine replaced as the right ear bud quit working shortly after arrival.\n",
      "Well these are my second pair. I love them. They do fall out your ear sometimes but they are worth it. I love how it brings out the bass of my music. And they are great for taking calls. They lasted a pretty long time the first time I had them. I believe several months I'm not sure. They are great.\n",
      "Perfect.\n",
      "works like other apple earphones but i hate the fact that they fall out my ears.\n",
      "You can tell it's not real, and it comes apart pretty easily. The sound quality is normal and fine, but the material/ plastic part, I don't like at all.\n",
      "Excelente.\n",
      "The best earpods I've used so far. It sounds great and provides a comfortable fit.\n",
      "great product at good price.\n",
      "Very happy!\n",
      "Buen producto!\n",
      "I haven't opened the ones last ordered but I have 2 pair that are about 4 months old.  They still operate (and that is remarkable from among others I have tried) but seem to be becoming a bit less reliable.\n",
      "Total crap. NOT ACTUALLY MADE BY APPLE\n",
      "I like them. The right ear bud is a little odd, sounds like a radel when you shake it. But anything else, it's fine\n",
      "Item arrived quickly and worked very well\n",
      "works fine\n",
      "Perfect!\n",
      "It is great! I love them a lot!\n",
      "I'm not sure if I speak for all of the sellers, but the build and sound quality are literally identical to my Apple earpods. Definitely a rebuy for me.\n",
      "thank you it was good\n",
      "Excellent product, these are original earpods by apple\n",
      "Perfect!\n",
      "Great earphones for low price\n",
      "I loved it until i mistakenly left them in my pants and put them in the washing machine, but still this product is awesome. had a little issue at the beginning but they sent me a replacement\n",
      "Huge fan of Apple Earpods. What you get is well worth the price. They are not $200 headphones, but then again, you don't pay $200 for them either, do you?\n",
      "Apple headphones for a lower price thanks\n",
      "Despite some of the reviews these are indeed Apple ear pods. Came with all the correct packaging and instructions licensed by Apple. I love these ear buds. Reasonable price and I'll continue to use this product. The sound is amazing. Deep bass and they can handle a lot of volume. My first pair I broke on accident so they had to be replaced.\n",
      "Love my Earpods\n",
      "Stopped working after 2 months and now can't get an exchange. ridiculous.\n",
      "One of the earphones rattle. Seems refurbished. I bought a pair from this same person before and they seemed fine. Our dog chewed them up and I got a second pair but those ones were not up to par.\n",
      "Great EarPods\n",
      "They are so nice\n",
      "Absolutely terrible. The worst headphones witheth the word quality. Clearly a Chinese ripoff. You can tell when you get them. Do not buy. Seller is a Chinese thief\n",
      "Bummer, I thought these were genuine Apple ear buds but they are fake\n",
      "Used them once and the decrease volume part of the headset never worked and the packaging arrived cracked.\n",
      "I have went through a lot of cheap headphones in my day, but I love these headphones! When I bought my iphone 4, it came with a set of them which I'm currently using now. I bought an extra for backup, cause if something happens to them I want the exact same ones!\n",
      "good\n",
      "Just like OME. Perfect\n",
      "I do not normally write reviews, but due to the fact this so-called \"Apple EarPods\" is a complete KNOCK-OFF and RIP-OFF, I had to warn other potential buyers. Not only does the remote control not work (turning volume up and down is useless), but the earphone itself literally pops out of the port on the phone where it should be connected to. Which causes the music to stop-play-pause, causing it to sound as if there is some kind of shortage in the wires. If I could have given no stars on this product and the seller I would have gladly done so!! I would suck it up and purchase the real deal from Apple. You get what you pay for.\n",
      "Great sound...tried many different ear buds, these are the BEST\n",
      "i really like it\n",
      "It not real!!! It is not Apple!! was damaged, is a cheap imitation !! and I sold him as if they were the original !!\n",
      "Very good\n",
      "DO NOT BUY! I bought this headphones not knowing that my phone had headphones already with them. I hadn't used them in months, but when my headphones that came with my phone started not to work, I used these. The sound quality is VERY low! I couldn't increase nor lower the volume because it didn't work. Avoid these headphones and save your money!\n",
      "EXCELENTE\n",
      "Don't bother with these. My friend unfortunately lost her Apple headphones and ordered these as a replacement, but to her dismay she found out these are definitely not the real deal. They look the part, but after spending some time comparing and contrasting to the OEM (original equipment manufacturer) headphones they just didn't compare. The sound was lacking (greatly) and the overall build just felt cheaper. Buy directly from Apple, folks.\n",
      "Came very fast. They came in apple case, they work very well. Just like the oem version. Glad I purchased these!\n",
      "Perhaps I received an unusually defective set of earpods, but I suspect these were either Apple rejects or counterfeit. The reason is the quality was not the same as the set I received directly from Apple. The left ear speaker was loose inside the casing. The microphone buttons required noticeably more force to depress than my original Apple EarPods. Upon close examination, I can see the microphone button case is flawed. Finally, the wires when unwrapped maintained slight, but noticeable kinks in them which did not go away over time. Again, this is unlike official Apple EarPods, where the wires maintain a nice un-kinked line if treated properly. I ended up buying a replacement set directly from Apple and received exactly the quality you would expect from an Apple product\n",
      "stopped working after two weeks very unhappy\n",
      "Great earpods!\n",
      "Excellent sound and very good seller\n",
      "crap, i mean you can hear stuff, sometimes. but the other times, NO. + it screwed up my iPad\n",
      "Their Good\n",
      "perfect\n",
      "fake as fcuk\n",
      "Very good\n",
      "I figured I would take a risk and buy these low priced EarPods, and I wasted my money. Only the right pod worked, and the plastic is very low quality. Not to mention the shipping took almost a month. I would not buy again, but you can try your luck.\n",
      "I found this earpod as cheapest earphone which have some quality sound\n",
      "I will be reporting you to apple for trying to pass these off as Apple Products. I knew once I took them out the packaging and touched them they felt fake and she I connected them the quality is terrible. I want a refund.\n",
      "they work great awesome sound.\n",
      "One ear piece stopped working within a few days.\n",
      "These are fake.\n",
      "I love the way these fit in your ears as opposed to the regular share ear buds. The sound quality is great!\n",
      "Nice headset but constantly falls out of ears.\n",
      "These really don't seem like actual apple products.\n",
      "Great quality! Shipped in good time- love these headphones!\n",
      "Broke after2 days\n",
      "One of the headphones stopped working within a week of receiving them ):\n",
      "Standard ear buds.  No complaints.\n",
      "Freaking love these headphones. Knocked off one star because they slip... Quite rarely though. But it does happen. Usually at the gym; mainly when on the treadmill, while lifting they're fine and even running on a track they stay on. But that damn treadmill\n",
      "really works nicely with my phone\n",
      "Fake fake fake fake fake. They rattled, were far cheaper and lighter feeling than Apple headphones, and threatened to break within a week.  Returning!\n",
      "The headphones are not original apple headphones. As expected, they worked for around 2-3 months until they broke. The earpod unattached from the cable somehow.  Great if you want a temporary set of heaphones.\n",
      "Perfect!\n",
      "THESE ARE FAKE.  I was fooled by so many 5 stars reviews, but make no mistake about it, these are low quality obvious fakes.  If you've ever used real Apple EarPods you'll recognize the tinny sound, poor quality wire, and lousy microphone immediately.  These phones are complete garbage, don't waste your money or be fooled by bot generated 5 star reviews.\n",
      "Love them\n",
      "very happy with the buds...\n",
      "Ive had these headphones for almost 2 weeks and the right headphone breaks... They click and clack because they are fake and im very unsatisfied.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don't be deceived, these are no wear near Apple quality. The earbuds themselves are poorly made, I can hear parts inside rattle as I put them in my ear. The speaker parts themselves freely rotate to face the wrong direction. At this price it is a rip off.\n",
      "If you prefer the use of ear buds to traditional over-ear stereo headphones, Apple EarPods are an excellent choice in this category. Apple recently updated their standard ear buds to the EarPods and I couldn’t be more satisfied with the replacement.\n",
      "Exactly what was offered.  I'm very happy with my purchase\n",
      "1 word : perfect\n",
      "I don't think these are real Apple earbuds. They feel really cheap, and very plastic like. Definitely not like the ones you get when you buy a new iPhone or iPod.  The volume on them isn't as good as my original ones either. Very dissappointed with this purchase.\n",
      "Well, I had them for a few months and they seemed fine.  Sound quality was poor, but what do you expect from earbuds?  Today I dropped them on my desk from a height of ~2 ft and one of the headphones broke open. Repacking the diaphram and coil made the earbud sound like I was listening to music through a kazoo.  Total junk, once broken open you can see the diagpham is just a thin piece of saran-wrap esque plastic so no wonder they sound even worse than most earbuds.\n",
      "Was a bit blurry on the phone with others\n",
      "Fake, fake, fake!!!! Don't feel as Apple EarPods, don't work properly!\n",
      "headphones sounded horrible and fell apart after one day.\n",
      "Outstanding sound quality and the item was received exactly as it was advertised. I know I'll never order cheap replacement ear buds again when I know I can reorder (if needed) from this seller.\n",
      "These aren't no \"Apple\" earpods. These are some cheap, fragile \"earphones\".\n",
      "This earphone is not nothing compared with the one pictured on Amazon . The one I received is a bad quality and the sound is  ugly and  sound very low . It a wasted of money . I had to buy another earphone but this time I chose the new Apple earphone for about 20 dollars and this one really worked and the sound is amazing . The other earphone cost me about 7 dollars so is better to pay a little more money to get a better quality earphone\n",
      "Horrible,\n",
      "Seller Datavision is selling fake knockoff product.\n",
      "These are cheap knock offs. The volume control was broken upon arrival and the mic casing fell apart within a week.\n",
      "Great phones\n",
      "It's the same as Apple headphones\n",
      "I love this headphones, this is my 5th time replacing my lost ones\n",
      "It's annoyingly short and the button to control everything is hard to press\n",
      "Its look like true apple without mistake.\n",
      "Not the real apple ear pods. Why sell them if they are not the real apple product or put them in the apple case?\n",
      "I'm happy with my purchase.\n",
      "Neither the buttons or the mic work with an android phone. The Earpods are too big for my wife's ears, but they fit mine. If you use the small sized rubber earphones on noise-isolating headphones, these will not fit. These are also not noise isolating, as the hard plastic does not block out street-noise as well as rubber ones.\n",
      "work great.  good value\n",
      "Not sure what the deal was with these, but the speakers were loose inside and sounded like the ones I inadvertently sent through the wash.  I had these exchanged at the Apple Store instead of shipping them back.  I was questioning if they were bootleg knock off apple headphones...\n",
      "Perfect!  Love them\n",
      "They are not authentic or new. Something is rattling in the left bud and the plastic casing was sliding off. Just buy from Apple directly.\n",
      "junk\n",
      "good\n",
      "Knockoffs. Not worth the money.\n",
      "Excellent job.\n",
      "exelent\n",
      "It seemed okay at first but then less than a day later, one of the earbuds popped off and the other one stopped working. Don't waste your money.\n",
      "the sound is really terrbile\n",
      "Fake Apple Earbud. I am really unsatisfied with it.\n",
      "I was a bit hesitant to buy these earbuds, after reading the reviews. I deceided to buy them because quite a few people said they worked well, and that they were legit. They were also reasonable. These are NOT apple earbuds. They did NOT work. One earbud worked, but the other did not. If you purchase these , you are taking a chance. It looks like returns are easy, but it's inconvient to return them and buy new ones. My recommendation: find another pair!\n",
      "Great sound. Comfortable to wear.\n",
      "will buy it again\n",
      "It said it comes with a remote?????? There was not a remote included.\n",
      "These are counterfeit goods, as confirmed by an Apple Store employee who examined these headphones.\n",
      "Love these.  My son and I buy them because they fit our small ears.  I have gone through so many earbuds trying to get a good fit but none work out because of my tiny openings to my ears.  These will sit in the \"cup\" of your ear so they don't clog up the opening and let air flow through.  My 16 year old son loves them too and insists I buy them again when his others get worn out.  they last a long time and the sound is great too.  Good balance with bass and treble so music or talk sounds great.\n",
      "Fake earpods. One of them had a busted speaker. DO NOT BUY.\n",
      "Good\n",
      "my son loves them\n",
      "fake headphones. the mic doesnt even worl properly\n",
      "The remote was weird, sound quality wasn't good and r almost broken in one day DONT BUY THEM\n",
      "I bought them to replace the ones I got from apple when I got my i phone 5 and I'm pretty sure what I got were fopods with wimpy cables and cheep plastic.\n",
      "I purchased this item for my daughter and she is happy with it thanks.\n",
      "These are good sound for any tablet or mac when i get my macbook.\n",
      "Do not waste your time buying these. They broke so easily in the first week of use. Spend the money and get real earpods from Apple. That was painful for me to say... but it was the truth.\n",
      "How to recognize a fake?\n",
      "These were sold as Apple headphones, and have Apple listed as the manufacturer, but they are fakes - pretty good fakes, but still fakes.\n",
      "So I spent $33 on fake ass headphones WTF!!!!!\n",
      "These are FAKE!! DO not buy.  They came with TWO R buds!!!\n",
      "Fake. Fell apart in my hands after I opened it. Not original Apple!\n",
      "These are clearly counterfeit.  I compared them directly with \"real\" Apple earbuds, and there is a huge difference in quality.  Junk.\n",
      "Fake Apple earpods\n",
      "I used them once… The mic with the volume up and down doesn't work anymore!!!!\n",
      "Fake and cheap replica\n",
      "Fake apple earpods, don't buy!\n",
      "best headphones for the price. and with a mic that works incredibly! even if its windy out i can still have a conversation with someone on my phone (via the headphones and mic) and everyone says that they hear me clearly! this is the 2nd set i've bought and recommend them to everyone!\n",
      "The earphone was just has the same shape as the original one. the speakers are very weak and the sound quality was very low. the right speaker was also noisy from the beginning and after a few weeks the noise became louder. I strongly recommend to buy the original ones from Apple or other cheap brands instead of this one.\n",
      "Terrible sound quality. Nothing like the previous apple earpods i have had.\n",
      "Great earbuds! Excellent bass and sound overall. Very satisfied.\n",
      "These earbuds are not the same weight as Apple earbuds. They also lack clear base sound. I have had these for 48hrs and the sound quality has rapidly diminished.\n",
      "Apple is Apple! Exelent quality! Love it.\n",
      "worked ok for about 3 weeks and started to sound bad. Go buy ear candy earbuds for $19 at walmart. It is what I have now and sound great\n",
      "I bought them to replace the earbuds that came with my iPod Shuffle because the write up stated that they work with ALL iPods.  They don't.  I have a 3rd generation, 4 GB, Shuffle and the remote doesn't do anything.  Waste of $20 based on false ad.\n",
      "THESE ARE NOT REAL APPLE EARPODS. They came in an Apple container, which was scratched and not closed properly- it was taped shut, and one side of the cover was not even snapped into place, indicating that the box had been opened before. When I took the headphones out, the wire was thinner and the plastic felt light and cheap. I plugged them in and it wouldn't fit properly in my phone, and the sound was tinny and very low, and had a constant high pitch in the background.\n",
      "Paid for real Apple EarPods, but received fakes. No product box, no warranty - just just the plastic case with fake Apple EarPods.\n",
      "these headphones work great and you can hear people clear. Love it so much I order another one.\n",
      "Opened the box, only one ear worked, the plastic was very flimsy, and the bottom part where there used to be a hole is filled in with plastic.  I have a hard time believing these are actually manufactured by Apple.\n",
      "bam. gets the job done after I lost the ones that came with the phone.\n",
      "Disappointed very cheap quality sound is terrible deff not worth 30 bucks\n",
      "Obviously fake. Cord is flimsy. Logos are asymmetrical. Sound quality is extremely bad. Buttons are stuck or outright broken. Just don't buy this.\n",
      "Faulty earpods. Beware not sold by 'Apple'. The product came broken.\n",
      "These are awesome. Not sure that they're official Apple ones but they look and act just like them...but for half the cost. I've had them for almost a year now and NO ISSUES.\n",
      "I cannot get these buds to stay put in my ears. The sound is good but not when they keep hitting the floor.  I had heard that Apple had improved there buds but they did not.\n",
      "DO NOT BUY. Not The Authentic Product.\n",
      "Some other reviews implied they got a cheap Chinese knock-off. I suspect they bought the ones listed at 2 to 3 dollars, and got what they got. Does anyone really think Apple sells anything for $3?!? I bought the ones priced a little under $20 and they are the real deal, including the nice Apple wind-up/storage case. FYI, all of the phone and volume functions work with my Samsung Galaxy S4. The headphones themselves are very comfortable for long periods of time and although I wouldn't say they are audiophile quality the sound is surprisingly good for a set of $20 buds. A little light on base but not bad.\n",
      "Sound quality was fine. The durability of the product is pathetic! All I do is use them running: I don't strain or stretch them, pack them in weird places, twist, pull, or abuse them. Yet the rubber broke in two separate places, exposed the wires & eventually caused the sound to go out. All within ONE WEEK of purchase! Ridiculous! It's not even worth the money shipping them back because I don't want another pair. Go with the original ear pods, this are awful.\n",
      "Yes probably fake but for 20$ there great! It's really hard to tell the difference between these and my real apple ones.I wear mine while I run almost everyday and have had no problems.the sound quality is good enough to make you unsure if there real or not.had them for maybe a year.\n",
      "Very good\n",
      "Good replacement for the ear pods I lost. They seem to authentic Apple product.\n",
      "Headphones arrived fairly quickly in original packaging would order again.\n",
      "I brought from this dealer whom I don't quite understand why he is the #1 dealer for my reason.. But anyways , I brought a pair of earphones and 2days after arrival one side just stopped working for no apparent reason and I was not able to return them. I do not believe they are genuine earphones . So beware of this dealer.\n",
      "Not sure if these are true apple earpods, but they sure seem to be. The sound quality is excellent, which is all that matters to me.\n",
      "Not great for using at the gym or running.\n",
      "The bass is pretty good but the only problem is that the volume wont go up or down on the mic.\n",
      "When I had gotten my iPhone, these earbuds have come with it. I was very pleased the sound quality and comfortability. However about 4-6 months later the chord had started to wrinkle and the left earbud stopped working. I believe it is my fault for how I had taken care of them.\n",
      "DO NOT BUY!!!!! These headphones are fake!!!\n",
      "I love it and i will buy it again\n",
      "They hurt the inside of my ears. I had to go back to the older model of earbuds- they are much more comfortable.\n",
      "The EarPods I received were fake.  They sound nothing like the two other pair I already own.\n",
      "Good but overpriced.\n",
      "Beware of these imitation earpods - they look very similar but the sound is noticeably inferior to the genuine Apple product. Not sure how they are able to be listed as an Apple product when these are counterfeit. As other reviewers have mentioned, just order from the Apple store instead.\n",
      "Liked the way they fit, however it wasn't long before it broke.\n",
      "Work great!\n",
      "These earpods are great. They are especially great when I use them for conversation on my iPhone.\n",
      "Very happy with these. I had purchased a different brand for $5.99 a couple months ago. They didn't work right from the beginning. These Apple earpods are well worth the money.\n",
      "Got for my hubby.  He loves it and so do I :)\n",
      "Lol ,one ear bud broke a week after receiving.i didn't realize they were knockoffs,\n",
      "I don't usually write reviews but this needed one. Do NOT buy these headphones. I repeat DO NOT BUY THESE HEADPHONES! I've had them a day and already one ear piece is not working. They are far from Apple quality products. I am just going to go to the Apple site and order from there to avoid this situation again.\n",
      "I WISH I WOULD OF PAID FOR ORIGINAL APPLE EAR PODS WITH REMOTE AND MIC.  DOES NOT MATCH THE APPLE EAR PODS WITH REMOTE ORIGINAL MANUFACTURER WISH THAT THIS SELLER WOULD HAVE GIVEN ME ORIGINAL SONY PRODUCT. SELLER NEEDS TO MAKE SURE HIS DESCRIPTION OF BEING OEM IS ACCURATE. WISH THE SELLER WOULD TAKE THEM BACK.\n",
      "Lost my Apple EarPods and attempting to look for a reasonable replacement. Not too bad. But very cheap quality.\n",
      "The most comfortable ear phones I've tried.\n",
      "Thought they were the real deal. Sadly not. Product was cheap and fell apart quickly. Earbuds didn't stay in ear. And sound quality was crackly. Waste of money.\n",
      "I like the improved sound quality, but they still really hurt my ears.\n",
      "Listen... What ever those Damn one stars say I think it a bunch of bull I thought the 5 stars were bots lol like too good to be true type of crap don't wanna curse so anyways yea I'm buying a second pair from them. I trust their stuff is legit hopefully my second pair hurry up I got my first pair stolen when I was studying must have fell out of my pocket and no one told me learned my lesson anyways amazing headphones at an outstanding price im 17 btw\n",
      "I got these headphones from the iPod Touch 5th Generation 16gb (or like the cheap iPod model) and do not like these at all!\n",
      "EarPods are ok, but the left one keeps coming off.\n",
      "They are not original and the mic makes a sharing noise when u move\n",
      "wonderful\n",
      "Bad quality\n",
      "Nice\n",
      "very good, although it does not sound like the original earpods\n",
      "Came just in time works amazingly 5/5\n",
      "OK for the price\n",
      "I am one who is very much into good audio and have put a lot of money in good headphones. For the price, performance, and durability of these, I like them a lot. They stay in my ears nicely, and I can shove them in my pocket without having to worry about anything happening to them. They are great for on the go listening.\n",
      "I needed another pair of earphones for my iphones as well as other devices so I bought this one.\n",
      "Broke almost instantly\n",
      "I purchased these earpods in 2014.  Last week I forgot to remove them from my pants pocket so they went through the wash and the dryer.  I had doubts they would work after that but with a test call I was pleasantly surprised - they worked just like new,  Now they are sparkling clear and back in my pocket.\n",
      "They are great replacements & great price!!!\n",
      "They break after a while.\n",
      "Product appeared to be in good condition but the microphone didn't work with phone calls\n",
      "It was good.\n",
      "my cat chewed up my old ones, so i replaced them. i like the new form factor.\n",
      "The  best !\n",
      "Excellent quality. Durable (can withstand being tossed around in my purse for days on end). Good Sound. A+\n",
      "Not Genuine Apple, poor construction, failed shortly after purchase. Avoid.\n",
      "These shocked my ears and the microphone did not work\n",
      "Left earbud not working.  Don't buy.\n",
      "Decent sound but I don't like the shape of the buds. They're uncomfortable and won't stay in. Radio Shack has some with the \"Skull Bonz\" style buds that are iPad/iPod compatible- the controller even works!\n",
      "These are some of the cheapest knockoffs I've ever used. Terrible\n",
      "These were a terrible knockoff of the actual apple earbuds. I paid just under $20 for something that fell apart within a week of their delivery. If you want Apple earbuds, buy them from the Apple store. If I could return them easily I would, but instead I just put them where they belonged - the trash.\n",
      "Just like OEM.\n",
      "i dont like apple but these buds are really good in sound\n",
      "For the price, people should not complain. These are by far the best in ear headphones for $30 you can find all around. The Shure headphones may sound better, but these are the most comfortable unless your ears are weird.\n",
      "Bought this from a crappy seller. Earphones are terrible quality. Not the real Apple earphones.\n",
      "These are junk . Don't waste your money. Broke after a few uses.\n",
      "good product\n",
      "Sucked\n",
      "Bought these to replace my earbuds that just...disappeared, received them after a few days but the problems were immeidate upon removing them from the package - there was noticeable distortion in the way the earbuds delivered sound. Immediately filed for return because I've had enough headphone problems in my life to know that it just gets worse.\n",
      "Totally failed in 3 days, but Amazon as always, took them back and returned my money.  My original pair had the same problem.  One of the earbuds simply quit working\n",
      "Sound quality is great. However, these ear buds are quite large, slick, and don't fit snugly in my ear and I have regular sized ears. I found that purchasing the Earskinz earpod covers was necessary to make the ear buds useful. The covers create enough friction that the ear buds stay in place. But they are not as good as other for exercise because of the fit.\n",
      "Excellent sound\n",
      "These are the official apple ear buds as they debuted with the iPhone 5. They're advertised to fit your ear more ergonomically and provide a bass boost for your music. I know what you're thinking...people only buy these because of the \"Apple\" name, but no, these headphones REALLY do make a difference. I first tried them out after my old apple headphones got ruined and I was surprised to hear a definite increase in bass with my music. Just the right amount too. They do stay in your ears better too, so I'm not sure why headphones weren't designed this way in the first place.\n",
      "Very cheap, after a day the connection into the iPhone pulled loose and the wires were visible.  Don't know if this was a knock off but they came apart.\n",
      "Pretty good quality EarPods.\n",
      "well\n",
      "They have great sound but are not Comfortable in my ears after a while. :(  too big I think?\n",
      "they are nice and loud, as well as working fine when i got them. I've used them for about a week, everyday for atleast 3 hours a day. They work great\n",
      "Great product and much better then paying what you would at an Apple store.\n",
      "still the best earpods, according to my teenaged son who has tried SO MANY different brands.\n",
      "I bought these because the original set I received with my iPphone quit working, specifically the blue tooth and volume adjustment.  These did the same thing within two weeks, at least my original pair lasted almost two years!!\n",
      "These are great and work very well.\n",
      "They are comfortable and clear.\n",
      "One of the earphones didn't work like the other side. It was very low.\n",
      "Came in the way I expected them to. Value for money.\n",
      "Broke the first day\n",
      "These are the best headphones for a decent price out there.\n",
      "Great on the plane!\n",
      "I feel like I was tricked into believing these were real Apple headphones. They are not. They have no bass, and are poor quality. I am very disappointed in this purchase and wish I was able to get my money back. \n",
      "Purchased these Apple EarPods as a birthday gift for my niece. She says that she loves them!\n",
      "Perfect!!!\n",
      "It says Apple sells this product but I don't believe it. The earpod felt apart after 1 month of use and the sound was very bad. I used the same earpods I purchased from Apple store and its sound was way better than this product. Be aware customers!\n",
      "Good price and they are not fake so i am happy\n",
      "Great sound!\n",
      "Very comfortable.\n",
      "Nice basic earbuds with a microphone. Not much else to say!\n",
      "after owning these 2 weeks they kept falling apart and the sound has a constant hiss to it.\n",
      "The two stars are generous. They worked well for the first month. Then...\n",
      "I bought these in September 2014 and by the end of December 2014 the left ear is cutting in and out.  I listen to them while sitting on a bus and sitting in my office.  Most nights I also use them on the treadmill, nothing extreme that should cause them to go out this soon.  These are cheap and not worth the money.\n",
      "One of the ear buds didnt work. Didnt see any way of sending these back?\n",
      "Broke after a few months\n",
      "Son loves them.\n",
      "Left ear didn't work\n",
      "Okay so these certainly are NOT actual apple headphones but I like them. The sound is good, they're comfy, etc. but, they will break after a while. Mine normally last a few months, and then I just get a new one. Overall, they're fine I guess.\n",
      "Apple earpods at a great price and best of all they have lasted longer than any other ear phone I've tried.\n",
      "very good\n",
      "There is no microphone. It's just a pair of headphones. Not what I was expecting and not useful.\n",
      "Enormously surprised with and satisfied by these phones (sorry Amazon; got them for free with iphone).  For some, they may not fit, as it's a particular size and shape optimized for average ear canal shape (with Apple aesthetic, of course), hence some of the lower ratings for others.  Also, midrange and high range is not the most crystalline sound one would hear on the high end phones ($200+), but the sound of these compared to the old earbuds and the higher priced ($50 to $110) phones is much, much better and a bit better, respectively (I have Klipsch earphones, which I loved in the past, and which l still use, if I want to more carefully hear cymbal percussion, for instance, but, these Apple Earpods are now the goto phones for music.  Bass is way better with the Apple product, but not so overwhelming as to be boom-box-obnoxious.).\n",
      "good deal\n",
      "They took their time getting to me, right towards the end of the approximate arrival dates. Within about a month, they had broken. They couldnt withstand being in my backpack for very long. Its about what you would expect for the price.\n",
      "Very good!\n",
      "this is a fake product, is not real the sound is sucks, this money have been wasted, and i had to wait almost a month to recieved.\n",
      "Horrible . headphones are not good quality\n",
      "These are not the apple ear pods. These are garbage. Sound quality is terrible, and the buttons don't work with my iPhone. They also took over a month to arrive. I would return them if they hadn't cost me $6. They are in the garbage now.\n",
      "Now if I can only get these back from my daughter...\n",
      "I like these, but I my ears are small.  These don't say in my ears so I don't get the nice base sound.. May just use them when I can't find my other ones..\n",
      "THIS WAS A GREAT PRODUCT! JUST AS DESCRIBED. BETTER THAN SPENDING $30 ON THEM IN STORES. . . .I WOULD DEFINITELY PURCHASE AGAIN FOR FAMILY OR FRIENDS\n",
      "The sound on these headphones has gone. They just got quieter and quieter over time, and this is the second pair that it has happened to. Very disappointed\n",
      "Apple products are like a high priced hookers that are pretentious. They claim to be the best and look real flashy and sleek, but at the end of the day it is just headphones (or vagina) that you payed for and that could only do so much :)\n",
      "Very good.\n",
      "Great product...as advertised!\n",
      "So far no issues, i got this as a replacement for my originals. I broke them on a plain seat :(. they seem to be exactly as the original.\n",
      "You can really never go wrong with these. They seem to last better than others do for me, I use them a lot!\n",
      "it's great!!!\n",
      "the earbuds worked for a while but then one side started to fall apart and now only one side works.\n",
      "Standard ear buds, work well.\n",
      "Looks and sounds just like the original apple earpods.\n",
      "Awesome. Everything they said it was.\n",
      "Works great, and a lot cheaper then buying from Apple or in the store.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remote stopped working after three months. The actual apple OEM earpods I've owned before, have worked for years. I'm going to purchase a set at the Apple store, and pay the extra money for guaranteed quality. It appears impossible to tell which of the earbuds on Amazon are actually OEM products and which are counterfeit.\n",
      "Item as described. Ships from abroad.\n",
      "Bought a couple different ear pods before, that all broke, these did not, they sound great and the microphone works well.\n",
      "Not the same quality at all of my original apple earbuds. Crackle when turned up to loud. They have a real plasticky feeling to the remote/mic controls when turning up or down volume and skipping/repeating songs. Would have paid double for higher quality.\n",
      "their the reak deak\n",
      "Works great as earphones should be. Haven't had a problem yet with them.\n",
      "Very thin wiring, not good sound, did not come in an Apple Box, came in an envelope. Returning\n",
      "Good\n",
      "Now I can talk to people!\n",
      "Stopped working after about 3 months\n",
      "There is a sharp peace on one of the ear peace. I do not have the paper work to send it back. It mad my daughter ear bleed. It was for a Christmas gift. It would cost me more to send it back even if I had the paper work. Not happy with this merchandise.\n",
      "These Apple EarPods were advertised as \"the real thing,\" and if you're looking to buy garbage that takes weeks to arrive from China, isn't fully functional upon removal from the packaging, and within a week of minimal use, doesn't even work at ALL, then it is the real thing. If you're looking for genuine Apple EarPods, stay far away from this crap. The volume and mic controls didn't work from the get-go, and within several days, one earpod didn't even output sound. A couple days later, nothing worked at all. YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!\n",
      "Pretty bad sound. Didn't seem like the real Apple headphones\n",
      "Love these things. Purchased em on cyber monday and got em for 7 bucks. Complete deal.\n",
      "Dropped once and they cracked open like an eggshell. But worked great up to that point. I'm not buying this style of buds again.\n",
      "Poor quality\n",
      "Garbage ...\n",
      "I bought this item thinking that it was being shipped from the US. To my surprise the item came from China. The EarPods don’t simply work. Spare yourself some frustration.Don’t buy this. During my phone conversation the people on the other end could not hear me.\n",
      "Great\n",
      "I been using earbuds from 5Below since my apple ones got lost, and sound there's a huge difference between them, best earphones I ever had.trust me there real I don't buy fake things and make sure they say designed by Apple in California on them in gray.\n",
      "It was good\n",
      "They didn't last that long before one side started to output audio quieter than the other, then the side cut out all together. They get a bonus for the microphone since it was useful, even though they lasted a month and a half.\n",
      "The product was exactly as I expected but didn't come with any sort of manual. I was able to get one online\n",
      "Naw... Won't stay in my ears. Sort of defeats their purpose.\n",
      "They're Apple designed. What did you expect?\n",
      "terrible sound quality\n",
      "Would give 0 stars if an option! These headphones suck! when I received them, they looked very nice and I was excited that I was getting a deal that I couldn't have gotten in the store. I wasted my money with these because I received them on Monday and they didn't even last until Friday. Junk. DO NOT BUY.\n",
      "These were not authentic and I was really let down.  I will be sure to check the authenticity more carefully in the future.\n",
      "work very well! Stays n your ear,all around great product!\n",
      "Just like the description.\n",
      "They work great only cord is shorter than normal which can be annoying when using from desk, etc.\n",
      "Good product\n",
      "Must have as a backup for bluetooth headphones with mic.  I've had two puppies that simply adore chewing these and rendering them worthless. Thankfully, they're not too pricy.\n",
      "Love it.\n",
      "The broke right away\n",
      "They didn't work\n",

      "Fast shipping as same quality as the ones that came with my phone originally\n",
      "mom loved em.\n",
      "It is very durable. I use them every day in my pocket and give some heavy abuse, and still they work perfectly. totally recomended for heavy duty uses. These have been the only headphones to last so long.\n",
      "The real thing really is better!\n",
      "mic did not work\n",
      "The earpods came in 3 days before the estimated delivery date which was a very much welcomed surprise. The earpods work very well, but the only issue I have, is that the volume button does not work on the earpods. Other than that everything is good to go.\n",
      "The headphones were exactly like the stock apple headphones you get when you buy an iPhone. Great sound and good quality!\n",
      "Great, great, I love these and the price was super!!!!\n",

      "Exactly as expected.\n",
      "works well\n",
      "The headset I bought looks exactly like Apple earbuds, but they are not ACTUAL apple earbuds.\n",
      "These worked for a very short period of time!!! Terrible!! Don't order!!\n",
      "These are legit and real Apple earpods. They shipped faster then I expected. Satisfied customer will buy from this company again!☺\n",
      "Earphone arrive in a timely manner and are working very nice am happy with my over all service\n",
      "non real\n",
      "these were genuine apple, in the full apple packaging, great value, sound good and fit my ears great.\n",
      "Very good earbuds\n",
      "It's over a year since I purchased these because I ended up finding my old headphones and did not need these right away. There is only sound in one earbud. Worth the money to just buy directly from Apple. I will never purchase again.\n",
      "100% fake. DO NOT BUY\n",
      "These ear buds are the real thing. I thought a little expensive but the quality is there\n",

      "Great..)\n",
      "The best mic option I've found, it's the only one I will use for business calls.\n",
      "I like the way these fit much better than the original ear buds that use to come with iPhones.  They fit much better, and have a left and right.  These are the same as the ones that came with the iPhone 5s.  I wore the others out.  Got them here for a great price.  Will be getting more I'm sure, but at least they don't break the bank.\n",
      "My son likes them so much, we had to order 2 encase he lost one.\n",
      "I use my Apple EarPods for listening to audiobooks using a CD player in my pocket while on the go.  I have been happy with Apple quality and durability, but use them heavily and eventually they wear out.  I recently acquired two new pairs, and I am very disappointed.  Although this model appears to have excellent sound quality, the cord between the jack and ear bud is about 9 inches shorter than my older Apple EarPods.  This makes it very difficult to move while attached to the CD player.  The extra tug on the cord also easily dislodges the pod from the ear, a problem already noted by many.  These are not good if you are active and keep your player below waist level.\n",
      "Product was new and working  well...I'm very satisfied with choosing this item..Thank you so much\n",
      "I love the sound\n",
      "Happy ,,,,\n",

      "great sound\n",
      "Fast shipping,  item as expected.\n",
      "They work great. Good Clear sound.\n",
      "It's a fake. Claims to be an Apple product but it's not. Mic doesn't work. Mutes me when I call someone with them plugged in. When plugged in my mac computer, iTunes would pop up and start playing songs. When plugged into my Galaxy S5, the volume would blast to the max. Do not buy.\n",
      "Good\n",
      "Excellent excellent product and service.  Incredibly fast delivery, great price, and authentic material. Thank you very much!!\n",
      "One side didnt work and wire was showing but i contacted seller and they were fast and very nice at giving me a refund.\n",
      "good stereo sound but hard to clean\n",
      "Not the original earpods... so feels Plato like\n",
      "works as expected\n",

      "I am satisfied\n",
      "Good\n",
      "Works great\n",
      "These headphones have a nice sound compared to other cheap ones I've bought, but they also don't last forever.\n",
      "These are great. If there a seller to buy from this is the one.\n",
      "Excellent.\n",
      "Very good,no complains so far\n",
      "These fit my ears well. I cant use \"in ear\" styles but these fit, are comfortable and sound well enough for me. good value\n",
      "Excellent headphones, worth the wait time for shipping, cable is a little short however. All buttons work\n",
      "Very comfortable.\n",
      "While these are supposed to be Apple products, they don't seem to be the same quality as what I get when I buy from Apple.  They do function equivalently but seem much more susceptible to breakage than similar Apple-direct purchases I have made.  Probably should be considered good for the significantly lower price but not what I expected.\n",
      "Ok product.  Works fine on my iPhone but it is Apple and mic does not work on my Surface tablet. And is over priced.\n",
      "Works very well.\n",
      "Don't waste your time and money. These are fake earphones that barely work and are made with the lowest of quality. I immediately threw mine out because it was useless\n",
      "Not Apple product. These are fakes and a poor imitation. Do not waste your money. Terrible sound quality.\n",
      "Great sound!\n",
      "As expected\n",
      "works great.\n",
      "Amazing fit, best bass response out of all earbuds, no more rubber trim, volume/pause functionality at it's best.\n",
      "Great headphones\n",
      "Don't waste your money.  These are knock-offs and do not work well (mic doesn't work for starters).\n",
      "works really well\n",
      "These were a replacement for my son (who lost his original iphone pods w/ mic) and appear to be a bit \"delicate\".  He managed to crack open one of the earbuds the first day he used them, but I was able to super-glue it back together.  I also used some heat-shrink tubing to beef-up the connection at the plug end because his method of removing the cord involves yanking on the wire.  Granted, my son is an extreme stress-test for anything ... But if you can teach a twelve-year-old to be more careful (not a chance at my house), the price is right.\n",
      "good quality at this price\n",
      "Received as advertised, prompt.\n",
      "Closest I have found to OEM at this kind of price. I have bought several times.\n",
      "good enough of the quality with the low price\n",
      "These are horrible headphones all of the positive feedback on this is a lie. The quality is horrible sound is very drowned out THEY ARE NOT THE ACTUAL APPLE HEADPHONES DO NOT BUY!!!!!!\n",
      "These are not genuine Apple earbuds. They are very close looking replications but are definitely not made by Apple. Upon receipt, the microphone did not work and I am returning.. very disappointed.\n",
      "song changer does not work. volume button does not work. save money and buy a cheap pair of regular buds\n",
      "Authentic headphones. Works perfect.\n",
      "These headpohnes broke the first 5 minutes of use waste of time and money showing was over 2 moths and know I have to go the doctors for a n ear contraction bloody ears\n",
      "These broke after one week. First one of the earbuds stopped working, then the remote fell apart. Definitely not the same quality as apple earphones...I think the cord is shorter too.\n",
      "The caps of the headphones keep falling off and when I use the microphone to talk on the phone people say they have trouble hearing me. Otherwise the headphones work fine and the remote works well. Wish they were a bit more durable, I am worried the headphones will break and I won't notice that the cap is missing. These broke after less than 6 months, one of the headphone covers popped off and unfortunately this time the little wire attaching the speaker in it to the cord and plug broke so they are done.\n",
      "Like new.\n",
      "The quality of these were so poor we dubbed them disposable ear buds they didn't even last as long as the ones from dollar tree, sad just sad.\n",
      "Ended up breaking within a few days and the sound wasn't clear\n",
      "Great quality and sound.\n",
      "Standard iPhone EarPods.  Came as described in the standard earbud plastic case.\n",
      "nice thanks\n",
      "Very good earphones. Would give them a 5 star if they were just a little smaller.\n",
      "This Apple original earpod is authentic for sure and have a good price.\n",
      "I did not purchase these from Amazon but never the less, these are quality ear pods. I think allot of people mistake these for the cheap imitation ones that come in different colors and cost less than $10 and if they have a problem with the cheap ones mistake those for these OEM ear buds when they write a negative review. The OEM's go for more than $20 - $30 and there is no mistake in the quality or craftsmanship and sound. If you want a great pair of ear buds for your Apple product or any other MP3 or portable product, these will work great on those. I have a Sandisk mp3 player along with an Apple ipod (4th gen) and use these ear buds to listen to my music and videos; the sound is great compared to the cheap ones which I made the mistake to buy and realized it is better to get the real thing. So if you have extra $, get these instead of the imitations.\n",
      "this is an absolute scam. If could rate no stars I would\n",
      "was very good investment, one speaker came in burned out but IDC\n",
      "I bought my headphones and they are geniune. They work great and I've had them for a couple of months now. I would definitly buy again if I were to lose them again or accidently mess them up. I am a college student and as much as I want to buy the ones at the store I cant afford to so I was happy when I reveived my headphones and they worked great.\n",
      "Broke within 2 weeks.\n",
      "Original apple earpods. Comes in original packaging. Works fine and serve the purpose. May be able to find cheaper products from other vendors, just make sure it is the original set.\n",
      "Very pleased by the timeliness of the delivery of the Apple EarPods, and with their lovely tangle-free case.  I am an amateur at tech stuff (56 yr old lady) so take this \"issue\" with a grain of salt:  I'd ordered the EarPods to go with a SanDisk Sansa Clip MP3 player.  The MP3 player was a gift for my husband, more affordable than an iPod, and I loaded it with his favorite audio materials.  I wanted him to have really nice earphones to go with the SanDisk, so I spent the extra money on the Apple EarPods.  However, there was a crackling sound when the Apple EarPods were used with the SanDisk MP3 player.  I tried the earphones that went with SanDisk and they worked perfectly.  Have yet to try the Apple EarPods with my iPod - will update this review if any issues arise there, but I doubt they will -\n",
      "Not sure if they were Apple brand because they do not control the volume when connected with iPhone 5\n",
      "Perfect!  Fast Shipping!\n",
      "Have not broken yet after 2 months.\n",
      "I don't believe that this was REAL Apple. I believe it's bogus. The packaging, while close to Apple is definitely NOT Apple packaging (Yes, I compared it to the EarPod packaging that came with my iPhone 6. NOT the same. As I live overseas, it makes no economic sense to return it.\n",
      "They were authentic, but they did not fit my ears.\n",
      "Worked great for a while then broke. Like most ear buds they just don't last. One ear went out before the others.\n",
      "Very good product.\n",
      "I received a genuine one\n",
      "Broke apart after using it for less than a month\n",
      "They're great! I didn't expe anything less it's an apple product.\n",
      "The mic has never worked and the pause/play button only works half of the time.\n",
      "good\n",
      "Does not work at all. Only hear people but they can not hear you. Big let down.\n",
      "Love them\n",
      "WARNING!!!!!!!!!!!\n",
      "The only product apple makes that's worth your money.I use these 95% of my day other brands break within a week or 2...These lasted me about 3 months until I made a mistake and washed them in the washing machine...they was left in my jacket pocket\n",
      "I just got these headphones and I really like them. They work fine and I put them through the ringer by working out with them. I like that they included the volume control! The sound quality is good and the build quality is durable. I had no problems at all with them!\n",
      "GREAT PRICE\n",
      "Accurate description & fast shipping\n",
      "Thank you\n",
      "Hreay\n",
      "These are a way better deal than buying the $30 from apple, but they break really easily. The top of the ear bud just popped off and even though I was able to easily pop it back on, the connection inside was severed and they no longer work.\n",
      "No issues after two months of regular use. As far as I'm concerned, they're identical to my original headphones.\n",
      "I ordered 3 of these.  Within 1 week 2 of them were broken.\n",
      "as advertised\n",
      "Not an Apple product\n",
      "I like it! but some times the people that I call said that they can't hear me clearly ... as my mouth is too far-low volume, but is normal position.\n",
      "Excellent Product!\n",
      "excellent\n",
      "I have weird/small ear canals and these are the first I've bough (FINALLY!) that don't fall  out!!! Sound quality is AMAZING.\n",
      "Clear sound, mic, cheap (for this product) and by Apple. Can't get a better price!\n",
      "Neither of the sets worked at all. I sent them back and asked for a refund\n",
      "I don't know why everyone is complaining about these earbuds being crap and falling apart, i've been using these from amazon for the last 10 months and they work perfectly fine like the apple earbuds that come with the phone.\n",
      "Fake product.  Shoddy manufacturing.\n",
      "I received these earphones and the mic/remote fixture was completely broken. After a few weeks they stopped playing out of one ear. Would not recommend at all.\n",
      "I love these headphones. They are the only ones I use anymore. They are fairly priced and have good quality sound.\n",
      "good quality\n",
      "Not used yet, but looks good\n",
      "They are OK. There was some damage on it but it works.\n",
      "Cannot hear.  These are muffled and not real Apple earbuds.  They are not worth the money!\n",
      "I have Beats by Dre and obviously the sound quality is not comparable but I found the EarPods to be durable and great for their price.\n",
      "Good deal\n",
      "The mic is not working.\n",
      "Had these earbuds for about 1 month when all the sudden the volume in the left ear cut out to about 15% volume until finally cutting out completely. The sound was okay for the price but for the time they lasted (1 month) they weren't worth it at all. I had klipsch earbuds that i bought for about 80 dollars which i used almost everyday for 3 years before i broke them on accident. Those were the best earbuds I have ever owned. The quality of my klipsch earbuds were superb and they fit perfectly and comfortably in my ear unlike the apple earpods which are a hard plastic that you have to force into your ear to get them to fit which irritates your ears. after trying the cheaper apple earpods for a month I'll happily go back to klipsch.\n",
      "I love it... Five stars\n",
      "Excelente\n",
      "I love apple\n",
      "although some of the reviews here said it wasn't the real apple earpod, I couldn't tell if it was or not, but as long as it works and had pretty good sound effects, it's good enough for me.\n",
      "work amazing.  love these\n",
      "Great quality!\n",
      "best bargain for apple ear plugs!!\n",
      "GREAT! But shipping took forever!!!!\n",
      "Do not waste your money on these. I was so disappointed because they came in defective. The mic and volume buttons were not working.\n",
      "Excellent.\n",
      "Beutiful sound  fits in your ear nice\n",
      "Break so easy so expensive too.\n",
      "Excellent earpods!\n",
      "it worked as expected\n",
      "Excellent quality!\n",
      "this is not authentic.\n",
      "EarPods have come a long way.  I like the volume control built in so you don't have to pull out the device to adjust.  The fit is good for me but I expect someone with very small ears might have some discomfort.  The price is good enough to buy a spare set.  I can no longer speak to the fidelity as my ears are 70 years old but I find a volume setting of 50% quite listenable.\n",
      "Great deal, excellent product, valued Seller, highly recommended A++\n",
      "Very happy with these earbuds!  Great price!\n",
      "It's fake! DONT BUY IT!\n",
      "great\n",
      "You are going to see lots of 1s when you go down the list of Customer reviews but most of them are unwarranted.  I feel bad for those whos product did not work such as 1 earbud not working.  How the headphones fall apart I will never know.  29 bucks actually is not too much to pay for a set of headphones with a remote and great sound.  I like the sound of the Apple headphones better than that of Bose, OH YES I SAID IT; to the horor of the self-proclaimed sound knowers.  Yes, you get better stereo, better separation, and better performance from Apple than from 5 times more expensive Bose.  And the Apple remote will never fall apart like the one from Bose does with its buttons coming off.  If the headset stops working after a year of daily use I am ok with it.  They are only earbuds, not made of concrete and reenforced steel, they are not supposed to last you a lifetime.  Example of better Apple sound.  If you use the Apple headphones and you go to your settings/music/EQ and set it to bass booster you will get a nice bassy response.  If you do that with a Bose headset you will get great bass, but volume will go down a bit, and you will have noticeably less stereo, like if all the sound got together in the middle instead of it being nicely spread.\n",
      "junk\n",
      "Works perfectly\n",
      "We live them. Very comfortable to wear\n",
      "My daughter loves them..think I may order a pair theyvsounds good\n",
      "They are good!! I give 5 stars. You should buy them!\n",
      "always loved apple products\n",
      "Delivered on time, headphones work as expected. Good sound quality, with rich treble and bass. Mic quality is also good.\n",
      "Using it for about a month now. It is inexpensive to buy from Amazon. A genuine apple product and works great.\n",
      "I bought these to replace a pair of old Apple earbuds that had lost sound in one ear. Two weeks after arrival, this pair joins the old in the trash for the same reason. Very disappointed.\n",
      "It's a pair of earphones, yes. I normally wouldn't feel the need to write about earphones seeing as that I normally purchase cheap ones and I am by no means an audiophile.\n",
      "My ear canals are tiny and/or weird-shaped, and these are the only ones that fit into my ears without falling out or hurting, AND include a microphone. I have used various Sony Sports earbuds for years, but I have been unable to find any in that style that have microphones. This works beautifully with my Samsung Galaxy (3, I think, not that it matters) as a headset for driving. So much more comfortable and staticy than any bluetooth I've used (even expensive ones).\n",
      "Good\n",
      "thank you\n",
      "Pretty good headphones and I don't even like apple products.\n",
      "They don't fit everyone's ears which is expected.But I thought they would be a better fit\n",
      "Although the sound is excellent, I'm unhappy about the ear fit.  Buds don't stay put\n",
      "My headphones broke in a few weeks. Not at all what I was expecting since apparently they were new.\n",
      "good quality!\n",
      "Perfect!\n",
      "Work great and half the store price.\n",
      "Excelent!\n",
      "Works fine\n",
      "I favorite headphones to date. Sound is great even maxed out. I think the ear-pods fit great, they almost never fall out during workouts, the sound is adjustable from the cable with a up and down volume option. These are the same as what Apple includes when you buy an IPhone.\n",
      "These worked great...for about a week. Everyone I call using these asks if I'm in a tunnel as they hear a bad echo and I end up having to remove them to finish my call. Will not buy again and will instead buy earbuds from apple directly to ensure I'm getting something that will last for a bit longer.\n",
      "price more than apple store\n",
      "Great Purchase! These are the genuine deal. I was very happy with the price.\n",
      "Garbage.  Sound was poor and they broke the first day when I dropped the case.  Don't buy.\n",
      "Bought these last year for Christmas and she loves them.  We purchased cheaper ones that look just like these but they aren't the quality.\n",
      "never use. Will raise more star after use.\n",
      "worked great\n",
      "Very happy with the Apple EarPods. I like the shape of the EarPod.  It fits nicely in my ear and doesn't always slip out.  The tone and volume are great for me.  I like the mike also.  It's handy to turn the volume up or down. Very happy with this purchase,\n",
      "Perfect\n",
      "it's not Apple's production and the controller and microphone don't work at all. Tried on my iPhone, iPad and Lenovo laptop. only the earbuds are normal.\n",
      "They not apple EarPods. It is not nice amazon.\n",
      "Do all these have a problem with the plug-in forcing you to bend the cord to hear the sound? I have had to return 2 of these so far and it is getting more difficult to find sellers for these any more.\n",
      "Great sound exactly what I wanted worth the money!! Such a great deal!!\n",
      "Best evah.\n",
      "Excellent\n",
      "Fake. I'm returning them. They look and feel like the the real ones, they even come in the Apple branded case. When you compare them with music it's night and day. I lost my originals that came with my iphone 5 but my wife still had hers and I used them as a comparison. I would NOT buy them again.\n",
      "Love them!\n",
      "Love them\n",
      "Terrible.  BOTH top parts of my head phones came off after moderate use.\n",
      "Nice\n",
      "Came brand new and work great!\n",
      "Does the job.  I use them often.\n",
      "I was afraid these would be knockoffs. They're not!! If you buy them from apple you'll pay twice as much as this price. I bought them shipping was so quick. I lost my headphones and music is want keeps me going through the day.\n",
      "Was not an apple product. Was an imitation both pairs fell apart in a day. Bought a pair on ebay that were real and they have lasted .\n",
      "These are a CHEAP knockoff of Apple's ear pods. The sound in the left ear bud is messed up, there is NO bass in these headphones, and they don't even FEEL like the real Apple Ear Buds when you wear them.\n",
      "They work great.\n",
      "I use 2 weeks and alredy not working.\n",
      "The clicker does not work. Yet again another cheap imitation\n",
      "The sound is ok, but the build quality and durability is absolute garbage.\n",
      "I paid a bit more than the minimum, but over $10 less than Apple's price, and got ones fulfilled by Amazon Prime (sold by LEADING EDGE not Amazon). The ones I received tested out as genuine (\"Designed by Apple in California\" on the cable, two-piece construction, etc.) and are maybe a bit brighter at this stage than the originals I got in my new iPhone 5 box. The main problem with these is that brightness, they are way brighter than most over-ear cans. But they work, are comfy enough, easy to clean, and have a decent mic too with volume and play/pause control.\n",
      "Just as good as Apple\n",
      "Best price ever for genuine Apple headphones definitely buying more\n",
      "The y are good\n",
      "till now its the best ear pod i have used. value for money and very good sound quality.\n",
      "Do not, I repeat, DO NOT waste your money!! Poor sound quality and cheap materials were obviously used on these headphones. I've purchased cheaper headphones that sound way better than these. Please, save yourself the money AND headache these crappy headphones will give you.\n",
      "They look and feel like iPhone headphones, but the sound quality is terrible.  I was using them for phone calls and was told it sounded like I was in a tin can.\n",
      "These are not the real apple earpods.  The sound quality is terrible.  Do not waste your money on these.  They are horrible.\n",
      "They weren't Apple ear pods and the fakes had a slice in the wire. The sound was awful.\n",
      "One of the earbuds came in not even working\n",
      "working fine.\n",
      "One week after, one of the EarPods was not working!\n",
      "This is not genuine\n",
      "They work great, work just as good as if i bought them directly from apple\n",
      "It was great because it came early, and it came with a special case for it and work really well, the sound quality is amazing, great buy.\n",
      "yes i was very pleased with the head phones.\n",
      "Best earphones around ... they actually stay in my ears.\n",
      "Came early and work great\n",
      "excellent working headphones! imitation or not, they work great!\n",
      "Broke after two weeks. Return however was smooth so a second star for that.\n",
      "The right ear broke after the first day and the left after the first weel. They did not meet my expectations.\n",
      "Exactly as described.\n",
      "One of ear buds doesn't work. After using it for 2 weeks\n",
      "Great alternative\n",
      "Pretty legit, good deal\n",
      "Excellent and great replacement at an even better price.\n",
      "they were great for one day... ONE DAY, the left earpiece stopped working after a day of no harmful use.\n",
      "Great value you will pay twice the price at Apple Store.\n",
      "Exceptional for the price. Great sound and overall. They fit me well, but if you're going to jog, run, or move a lot, you'll need to look elsewhere. They sit great in my ear, but much moving on my part and they fall out. I also love the controls,  they work great with anything apple, but not android. (Controls only work w/ apple, headphones work with anything.)  Overall, exceptional headphones for apple devises, especially for the price.\n",
      "good\n",
      "A very good product I bought them 2 month ago and still like work great I put them threw a lot I use them for work to hear music and their great they something's do fall of your ears but that happens to almost every earphones worth the money.\n",
      "Real nice\n",
      "They are not the original and they are really cheap. One of the headphone stopped working after three day :/\n",
      "Bad quality\n",
      "Not really sure whether mine was a true Apple brand, but the quality was high and it works perfectly.\n",
      "These earphones work exactly the same as the original apple ones\n",
      "Great buy!\n",
      "Not original. So Apple is not the manufacturer.\n",
      "Excelente\n",
      "This EarPods at first does not look original from Apple; second, the mic works sometimes. And when does not work, i have to disconnect quickly and answered the call without it, this cause multiple missed calls; third the remote volume does not worked at all. This EarPods are the high cost headphones without mic and remote volume. I really want to return it; but I know am going to lose more money (Wasting time not working in valuable things). So, I am going to gift it to my kid.\n",
      "The ithem is not original as it is written in the website\n",
      "Not is Original, this is a waste product\n",
      "These are fake. The difference can only be told by the pathetic sound quality in these.\n",
      "As many others have noted in their own reviews, this product is not as advertised. These are most definitely not Apple Earpods, this product falls apart after only a few days and during those few days of use it will shock the insides of your eyes. This product has poor sound quality and its false advertisement is an absolute disgrace.\n",
      "Happy with my purchase, have no issues or problems. Satisfied with price as in retail stores you pay $30 for these same earbuds made by apple.\n",
      "Apple EarPods with Remote and Mic are definitely not an apple product. The sound quality is not there compared to the original earbuds that came with my iphone but I gave it 2 stars because I paid about 8 bucks for them. Buyer beware!\n",
      "this item is a little dirty,i didnot know what happened, but it can be used good, so it is not a serious problem for users.\n",
      "Broke within 1 week of purchase.\n",
      "it is NOT Apple, broken in 1 week\n",
      "I love these!  I guess I have small ears because any earbuds I've used in the past have been uncomfortable.  These are so comfortable I forget they're in my ears.  I also love the feature on the cord of the right earbud that allows me to mute the sound if I have to answer the telephone or speak with someone.\n",
      "They are terrible\n",
      "Great headphones\n",
      "I purchased from this page on Amazon, expecting genuine Apple earbuds.  What I received looked like the real thing, but the sound quality is awful.  It sounds like I'm listening to music on a phone from the 80's.  Either Apple's quality control is really bad, or these are fake.  I'll let you decide which is the case.\n",
      "Great! Speedy arrival of products. Very satisfied with ear phones\n",
      "Don't believe the reviews. This is a cheap knock off scam. Buy them from apple. Your gonna get the real thing cheaper.\n",
      "These are fake apple earphones. The imaged showed that they are apple earphones, but when i got them earlier, the package had no apple logo and the sound quality was horrendous. Worst buy of my life ever. This is false advertisement and they should be reported for selling fake products. They should also remove the \"Apple\" word before Iphone 5 earpods because they are FAKE\n",
      "the product was genuine\n",
      "I bought these with the headline saying 100% oem..BULL!!!! Sound is like a muffled exhaust with stock intake box, sound isn't that good, the paint from the earbud aluminum net protecting the inside fell off, after rubbing it to remove any dirt from ears left behind and the AQUAMARINE PAINT fell off, apple oem is BLACK PAINT and the cord for these feel cheap too, apple oem cords are stronger and sound quality off a real oem EarPods is better\n",
      "The worst product ever...ordered 3...none of them working...one headphone case broken....seriously disappointed with Amazon\n",
      "Very poor quality! Only one ear piece works.\n",
      "very disappointed how they can announced like original apple product and is just a very Expensive fake version.\n",
      "crap-----didn't appear to be an apple product.  volume is low.\n",
      "These headphones are a huge improvement over Apples previous stock earbuds.  Full spectrum with strong base plus integrated microphone. ...  Def 5 stars !\n",
      "Great product...Great seller!\n",
      "They broke within a week, not real. Don't waste your money!\n",
      "Great\n",
      "Intermittent voice can be heard\n",
      "amazing OEM Earpods\n",
      "Love them!!\n",
      "THESE WERE ADVERTISED AS AN APPLE PRODUCT BUT THEY MOST CERTAINLY WERE NOT WHICH SURPISED ME BECAUSE I TRUSTED THIS WEBSITE TO NOT USE FRAUD WHEN DESCRIBING AN ITEM!!! I WOULD LIKE TO GET MY MONEY BACK!!!! A VERY BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!!!\n",
      "FAKE! BUYER BEWARE. OEM means knock off! I didn't know this prior to purchasing. My fault for buying this knockoff product. Good for doing things/going places where you don't care if your earpods get destroyed, like exercising or traveling.\n",
      "DO NOT BUY! I just got then and dropped then (no big deal) and the right earbud was destroyed!!! Now I need to buy new ones!\n",
      "FAKE!!!! Fell apart after one week. Listed as genuine, but found a stamp on them that is non-Apple. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS VENDOR!!!!\n",
      "They are a fake knock of brand don't buy these! If you want the really ones there are around 30-50 but money will be well spent\n",
      "Not the genuine product. The sound is okay but I've noticed a few flaws with the design which would not occur on a genuine Apple product.\n",
      "OPTIMO.\n",
      "People need to understand that these are not real Apple EarPods, apple dose not make colored EarPods. So before you buy these, if you want the real Apple ones you need to buy the plain white ones FROM APPLE.\n",
      "Excellent\n",
      "Terrible quality. These are knockoffs.\n",
      "My favorite pair of headphones!\n",
      "ok\n",
      "nice\n",
      "Decent, but pricy.\n",
      "These earphones are pretty good. They are comfortable and sound great,they came just as they look!\n",
      "I went to best but and used this for a price match and it worked lol\n",
      "Fast shipping. Genuine Apple Product. Good sound highs /lows. Can use for hands free calls.\n",
      "People helping were very nice..ear buds very good  but took to long to  too be delivered.\n",
      "The microphone on the earpods did not work right out of the box. Returning the item. Also, the earpods seem like well made fake earpods as there is a subtle but definite difference between these and the genuine ones sold in the Apple store.\n",
      "Exactly what I expected!\n",
      "These are great EarPods. They sound just like the ones from Apple. Wait, these ARE the ones from Apple.\n",
      "I thought I these EarPods where somehow and better than the pair that came with the iPhone.\n",
      "The sound only comes out of the right side of the EarPods. For genuine Apple EarPods, I am NOT happy with the quality of this item and will not be purchasing from this seller again\n",
      "Ok\n",
      "Excellent design.  These are the most comfortable earbuds to wear that I have tried yet.  They stay in place very well, and don't cause the pain that in-ear or the older circular earbuds cause after long use.\n",
      "The sound is perfect, but since the day one the microphone makes an horrible noise, so it's useless for me since I use it for conference calls. I though I was buying a premium quality product but I got that wrong :-S\n",
      "These are the real deal.  I watched the videos on YouTube about identifying the counterfeit EarPods.  I had thought for a minute that I may have been duped.  The price was great as well.  I had to replace two pair for Nano's because my kids where pulling them out by the cord.  So keep an eye on that if you don't want to replace another pair.\n",
      "Not Apple. Terrible sound quality. Faint hum when used for calls. Don't buy.\n",
      "Great, if you like ear buds. No complaints.\n",
      "Great for the price, if you like ear buds.\n",
      "Very good quality and sound for a headphone. I use them every day at work and don't want to miss them any more. Best and cheapest headphones I've ever had. Really nice!\n",
      "These headphones broke within one week. Cheap and not worth it.\n",
      "Horrible fake, the remote doesn't even work! I don't know why Amazon keeps this piece of garbage available for purchase. Extremely disappointed.\n",
      "Broken when can in.\n",
      "Worked well. No additional comments.\n",
      "Bad\n",
      "Originally it got lost in the mail and the replacement pair's volume up didn't work.\n",
      "excelent\n",
      "Fake!!!!\n",
      "Took a long time to receive headphones and the quality is not good\n",
      "These are the legit Apple EarPods! They work perfectly and came in the official packaging as if you bought them from the Apple Store in the mall. Couldn't be happier!\n",
      "junk not real Apple product\n",
      "It came with microphone defective...\n",
      "I had an apple ear pod i got form apple store, brought this one, my old one felt heavier and sounded better, but after a while of using this one, i didn't notice anything, still not sure if these are the real deal or just good copies, might just be in my head...but they did sound different\n",
      "I'll give the seller the props for the delivery service it came as promised unfortunately the product wasn't as promised it was a set of fake ear pods and in 2 weeks they kept messing up my phone and the remote stopped working and also they fell apart will not be buying from this seller again !!!\n",
      "Loved them plus it came with a thing to wrap ur headphones around , and u can carry ur phone and headphones with ease!! Head phones were real deal brand new, but They have packaging issues my lil box was cracked!! But thats the only issue here. Pros Realy Good.base!! dosent hurt my ears :)))))) good for jogging bike riding and just plain old chatting with family!! Works good mic and speakers.\n",
      "Terrible! DO BOT BUY I COMPARED THE ORIGNAL APPLE EARPHONES AND TGIS CHEAP TRASH AND THESE JUST SUCK, they feel cheap and sound HORRIBLE! You are going to waste money by buying these!\n",
      "Exactly what you get in the Apple Store at half the price.  By the way to make them even better check out Earhoox.  They go over the part that goes in your ear and make them fit snugly and securely.  Great for when you are working out or just walking around.\n",
      "Sonuds like original apple EarPods!\n",
      "Bought this a week ago and it just stopped working randomly\n",
      "I love music. I love this. I love you\n",
      "I bought these ear phones and returned them immediately. These are not the original apple ear phones. These guys seems to be making duplicate cheap version of apple ear phones. There is a lot of difference in the sound output of these earphones with the original apple ear phones.A big NO for these ear phones\n",
      "broke after 3weeks\n",
      "More fragile than egg shells. Durability is a zero. Sound quality is a zero. Save your money and get anything but this earpods.\n",
      "Within less then a week the earpods was not working and I had to buy a new ones:-(\n",
      "Good.\n",
      "Work well, sound is good and they are genuine Apple product at a big savings over the Apple Store.\n",
      "The unit I received were not genuine Apple ear pods. Cord was too short and after about 10 minutes of use volume/mute section came apart. Also there was a lot of echo reported to me when I called someone.\n",
      "They suck!!' Worst headphones ever don't but them! Save your money\n",
      "Headphones looked like original Appple BUT.... they were very used and inches of the wires had hundreds of small scratches.\n",
      "Fake. Do not buy.\n",
      "These are advertised as apple earphones and they are definitely not. Don't waste your money. He reviews that say these are the best ever are simply not true. The sounds quality is just ok. The biggest problem is using these as a microphone for phone use. People just can't hear me. They tell me that the volume is very low and I end up having to unplug the earphones and use just the phone. Not good while driving!\n",
      "Headphones work great but feel flimsy. Container came scratched but inside stuff was fine\n",
      "Fake. Not Apple headphones. You can feel the cheapness of the plastic and the mic was distorted in phone conversations. Took it to the Apple store and they confirmed that it's not their product although it looks very very close to it.\n",
      "Works beautifully\n",
      "can't use it on my Samsung galaxy phone :( but i love it on my ipad!\n",
      "Ordered a few. Some worked fine others fell apart.\n",
      "The sound quality is crap\n",
      "So far the EarPods work, but they are not new!  They have a crease across the off control and a mark on one of the Ear pieces.\n",
      "It's a fake Chinese ripoff\n",
      "these are not really apple earpods.  cords are cheaper, thinner and earpods have opened but what can you expect for 7 dollars.  should have spent the money for real apple earpods\n",
      "Legit. Buy it.\n",
      "These are the most absurdly uncomfortable ear buds I have ever worn. I can only wear them for 1-2 minutes before my ears hurt immensely. The sound quality is decent but not really comparable to other similarly priced products. Don't buy these ever. They are simply an inferior product.\n",
      "EXCELLENT\n",
      "Knockoffs. Sound quality is awful\n",
      "Favourite earbuds!\n",
      "Great sound and microphone\n",
      "Not the real Apple earpods, but cheap plastic rip offs with a short chord.  The left is louder than the right, the jack is a little too big so sometimes it doesn't initially go in.  DO NOT BUY IF YOU WANT QUALITY EARBUDS.\n",
      "What a piece of junk. Failed after a couple of days and tossed in the garbage. Certainly not like the real Apple buds.\n",
      "Item was great at first, but after a week it developed a short in the wiring. Would not play correctly. I ended up throwing it away and going back to the one shipping with my I phone.\n",
      "These are NOT original apple earphones. Please, change the product title, you are lying.\n",
      "These ear buds didn't work at all. Such a bummer.\n",
      "Only one bud working, obvious knockoff.\n",
      "Good buy. cheaper than the store however the exact same quality.\n",
      "The best earphones for this price period!\n",
      "One headphone stopped working within hours of using it\n",
      "Replacements for the original that broke when I dropped my iPad. Using them right now.  Great price, exactly as described.\n",
      "These headphones are great! I've been using them for weeks now with no problem\n",
      "awesome thanks\n",
      "They look just like the real Apple earphones but I compared both sets that I bought from this seller with the pair that came with my iPhone 5 and the sound quality is inferior. Also, in just a couple days of use, the wire has come apart at the plug.\n",
      "NOT AN APPLE PRODUCT!! It came 4 days late AND theres buzzing noises in the left ear bud. I wrote this review after 10 minutes of owning this product. Dont give these people your money.\n",
      "these are not apple head phones, they are fake. fell apart the first time I used them. NOT satisfied at all.\n",
      "same kind as apple.\n",
      "Compared these headphones side-by-side with my original apple factory earbuds. Are they the same? No. Would you be able to tell the difference in audio without a direct comparison?  Probably not. There's a slight reduction in overall bass and fullness of sound (coming from an amateur sound engineer). Would I purchase these again vs. the factory apple for almost half the price? Absolutely. IOS 7 user, I have no idea on IOS 8 platform.\n",
      "Item was listed as new. Arrived used and dirty in an envelope. Wasn't worth my time to return it. Still very unhappy.\n",
      "Totally garbage. People can hardly hear me.  They say I sound distant like a little whiny ant. You also get a lot a feedback as the headset picks up more of the background noise than your voice. Half the time there is an echo whenever I speack.Music sounds even worse. Also it's clear this isn't an authentic Apple headset as stated by the seller. It differs greatly from my previous one. It's also extremely uncomfortable in your ear. Upon further inspection I see that even though the mic is marked \"R\" for right ear, it's actually inverted and does not fit in the right ear but fits in the left. They couldn't even get that right.  I would give it zero stars if I could.\n",
      "Right ear bud stopped working after one month.\n",
      "On time, brand new.\n",
      "Love them\n",
      "Perfect and with fast service\n",
      "As good as any apple product\n",
      "It did meet my requirement\n",
      "After one month of use the wires at all the connections became exposed and they stopped working.\n",
      "Fake EarPods shorter cord than real Apple EarPods and sound quality is horrible. False advertising!\n",
      "It's the real deal and arrived on time\n",
      "Not APPLE quality, look to be a \"copy\" but ear buds are not the same size.\n",
      "Clear sound\n",
      "Sounded good, but the cord broke 2 weeks into use.\n",
      "This product doesnt even deserve 1 star.  When it arrived, the case it came with was broken into a bunch of pieces. When i went to try them, the right ear didn't even work.  Lasted not even 10 minutes before it was thrown in the trash.  Complete waste of money.\n",
      "The product did not even last for a month. not happy about it at all.\n",
      "my daughter says these look and perform like the real apple EarPods.  So I think these might be actually authentic.\n",
      "Broke the afternoon I bought it. But it thankfully it broke right before I had to board an airplane for 4 hours, and thus not allowing me to listen to music. Not the real thing. This plastic monstrosity can go suck a duck.\n",
      "love these earbuds, I use them all the time\n",
      "IT IS TOTALLY FAKE ONE. HOW COULD AMAZON ALLOW FAKE ADVERTISING!!!\n",
      "Right ear piece already broke... xD\n",
      "Fake\n",
      "Very low quality. The left ear bud fell apart the day after I got them from just having it in my pocket\n",
      "i bought this for my grandson,he loves it, in fact he bought 2\n",
      "These headphones are excellent . Sound very good I couldn't ask for a better earphone , trust me\n",
      "At last.  I found earbuds that fit and don't fall out\n",
      "Sucked. Broke easily and one side stopped working\n",
      "Love them, especially the mic. button I can turn it off without having to shut Ipod down......I use them  a lot when I am listening to a book....\n",
      "Thanks You+++++++++++\n",
      "FAKE!! They look real but once you compare them to real pair it quickly becoms obvious they are fake. The play/pause button is super loud and clicky but the ones from apple are a soft quite click. I took them to apple to have them confirm it and they did! Don't buy these!\n",
      "Absolute Turd.\n",
      "Fake earpods not real\n",
      "Fantastic ear buds! They fit very comfortably and the sound is amazing.\n",
      "Best headphones I've every used on a phone.\n",
      "Only have had them for 2-3 weeks and one headphone already doesn't work\n",
      "Apple earpods is great but I needed earpods for android so I can't talk through these\n",
      "great original and souns great\n",
      "These headphones work really well with any phone you have just make sure your phone has a high volume capability\n",
      "Good product\n",
      "So far so good. Of course these aren't the authentic Apple headphones but they do exactly as the original do. I don't know why so many negative reviews.\n",
      "These were fake, my sister had an actual pair from apple, and when I received mine they had a grey tint and the earbuds were a lot bigger. So they didn't fit in my ear and the volume control didn't work at all. PLEASE AVOID THIS PRODUCT. NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY.\n",
      "Well done\n",
      "These are genuine apple earpods and I'm very satisfied with my purchase.\n",
      "Absolute crap.  Purchased two sets together.\n",
      "These headphones are exactly like the ones that you can get at your local Walmart but for about 1/3 of the price. Great deal for some good headphones.\n",
      "I don't think the earbuds I received were made by Apple.  Very poor sound quality.  They look like Apple earbuds but don't sound like them.\n",
      "these earpods have great sound quality, but easily breakable. they are the genuine apple earpods and i was happy with that. at first i was a little sketchy, but it turned out that they were actually the apple earpods.\n",
      "Great earbuds. My son loves them.\n",
      "The \"Apple EarPods\" are packaged to resemble the Apple product, sans the Apple logo.  The wires are noticably thinner than those of the Apple produced product, however, and the \"real\" Apple produced earbuds do not fit into the container these were packed in.  The earpods I received are obviously counterfeit. The seller should have advertised them to be Apple compatible, but not led buyers to believe they were purchasing the real thing! I note, however, they were also priced at less than 50% of the retail price of the Apple produced earpods.  I guess one gets what one pays for!\n",
      "Upon receipt I could immediately tell that the headphones were not as high quality as usual. The sound was \"tinny\" in the right earbud (seemed to be missing the bass) and also rattled.  Seller refunded me my $.\n",
      "Wish I could give it \"0\" stars.  The quality isn't very good.  The shape of the earpod is like Apple's version and the earpods work fine.  The mic button is stiff and works most of the time but not all the time.  The hard plastic input plug casing broke within a few days of first use.  Sadly, I've been busy and missed my window of opportunity to return them. The label leads a less discerning buyer (me in this case) to assume that these were actually \"Apple Earpods.\"  I didn't know what \"OEM\" meant and I didn't look it up before ordering. The old adage about \"you get what you pay for\" bit me in the behind this time!\n",
      "I haven't gone wrong with Apple products.The ear buds make a good pair with IPhone's.I also recommend them for hands free use while driving with the remote and mic included.\n",
      "I bought these earphones and within one month the wire that goes into the jack separated and I had to tape it. Now 6 weeks into owning them the part of the wire closest to the micro-phone is spitting. I checked the return policy and the window for returns is one month. I am very unhappy with this product. It says that it is an Apple product but given the the defects that have happened to me I doubt it is a real Apple product.\n",
      "Positive\n",
      "FAKE.  These are not Apple EarPods.  This is false advertising.  Do not buy.\n",
      "These are fake. DO BNOT BY THEM. I AM SO ANGRY RIGHT NOW. THIS IS FALSE ADVERTISING. THEY ARE FAKE. DO NOT Buy\n",
      "When I got these headphones, one of them didn't work, and half of the wire fell off! I was very disappointed in this product, thinking that I had bought headphones that would at least both work!\n",
      "Poor quality, the sound from one of the earplugs is much lower than the other... ridiculous...very upset\n",
      "I got these based on the comments and because i know that these headphones are amazing, but the one i got from them was broken and the left ear pod didn't work at all so now i have to return it. it really sucks but i'm sure all those with good comments had a good one\n",
      "These are 100% fake / knock off's. Watch this video to see for yourself:\n",
      "The sound is really good...\n",
      "Get those that are by Apple, not the one that are by xGen. Apple ones are original Apple headphones (for $13.94). I just got them today and after all the reviews I had a doubt if headphones are original or not, but when I received them - no doubt.\n",
      "Not apple ear pods. terrible sound quality and a cheap imitation. DO NOT BUY!!!\n",
      "When I first got the headphones, there was static if the base moved, and if any pressure was applied, the volume would go down! The wires became exposed within a week, and sound only comes from this year\n",
      "I bought the white ones listed as \"Apple EarPods with Remote and Mic\". They arrived promptly, but they seem to be fakes, not a genuine Apple product. A couple of things stand out:\n",
      "GREAT\n",
      "Works Great with Iphone 4 and Ipod\n",
      "Other reviewers and shoppers have a lot of questions about whether these are legit Apple products since they're so cheap. I'm not exactly an audiophile, but comparing them to the pair that came with my  phone, I can't tell any difference between them.\n",
      "Don't waste your money buying these. They are knockoffs of Apple's Earpods. Go to Apple's website and order Earpods there, it's worth the $30.\n",
      "These do not appear to be authentic Apple earbuds as promised. The thick rubber insulation of genuine Apple earbuds keeps them from tangling; these tangle constantly. One of the earpieces fell off after about a week.\n",
      "Junk\n",
      "I dont think these were made by Apple not as good. The earpods sound goes in and our. Go to apple\n",
      "Im satisfied with this product, and transaction.\n",
      "Great sound at a good price.\n",
      "not good.\n",
      "Delivered as promised, excellent quality.\n",
      "These are great ear phones as well as a good hands free mic for your iPhone,plus cant beat the fact that it's much cheeper then in store prices!\n",
      "very good\n",
      "Not an apple product.  Compare these to the real thing and sound quality is clearly no match\n",
      "I love it!\n",
      "Not sure how well they work, wife went and hid them somewhere.\n",
      "I enjoyed my purchase also I had a problem the seller took time out to called me and explain what happen I will recommend his product to my friend and family\n",
      "Five stars all the way. Highly recommended. Fast delivery and most of all...item is authentic. A must have.\n",
      "I must have smaller ear canals, because they hurt after wearing for a ten-minute bike commute. But they are more comfortable than previous Apple earbuds, and they sound pretty good.\n",
      "Sound quality is terrible, buttons work intermittently and it has some copper wiring exposed.\n",
      "The volume piece on the right headphone has already broken after less than 2 weeks of use. Shoddy knock-offs.\n",
      "Buy fro, Apple.  Others sell illegal knock-offs that are cheap and break!\n",
      "Awesome..!!!\n",
      "Peace of doodoo they suck\n",
      "Love em\n",
      "What can I say about earphones that can go through the wash and dry cycle and come out perfectly fine?  These have the clearest and crispest sound and feel the most comfortable out of any earphones I've had.  They withstand abuse and are long-lasting.  This is the 2nd pair that's accidentally gone through the rinse cycle (thanks to my son).  I'll only buy these from now on.\n",
      "Great purchase\n",
      "Great product! Significant enhancement of earlier version.\n",
      "Very inexpensive and very good quality! A very good buy!\n",
      "Only one ear worked;I should've known better than to buy used earphones....Won't happen again....DISAPPONTED!\n",
      "Se escuchan muy bien excepto por el control para el volumen que trae en el micrófono no funciona\n",
      "They are lasting me longer then most headphones! I go through headphones like a kid with candy, they all tend to stop working within 3 month and yes I do blast my music (I listen to rock). These headphones have lasted me a good amount of time. Sadly the volume buttons don't work on the Note 3 but that's understandable since it's apple headphones.\n",
      "These headphones certainly LOOK like Apple EarPods but that's it! I was do disappointed. The first time I plugged them into my phone I couldht hear anything. I had to twist them around in the jack to hear something. When I say something, I mean the quality doesn't comlare either. I will never order these again. I wish I spent the extra $15 and  gone to the Apple Store!\n",
      "Good job\n",
      "This is my 3rd pair and I love them!\n",
      "Great product!\n",
      "i am very happy witht performance of these pods.  they were loose in mynear so i did end up getting something extra to hold them in.  in all great purchase formthe price\n",
      "Great item. These Apple EarPods with the Remote is just the thing I needed to listen to my music, especially the volume remote function which I can use to adjust the volume without having to pull my iPod out of my pocket and this function really helps me out if I'm on the move or mountain biking. Just an overall awesome product. Also, the Apple EarPods have a better form to fit the inside of my ear instead of always falling out like the old ones did.\n",
      "Perfect\n",
      "Very satisfied!\n",
      "i thought they were origibal from apple, i had to buy another ones to actually have the funtions working as it supposed to be.\n",
      "great!\n",
      "Excellent sound, they are originals, it is trustful\n",
      "These clearly are NOT 100% Genuine, etc. etc. Do read these reviews. The cord is way too short, and the controls don't work. Enjoy.\n",
      "awesome\n",
      "Only one of the two pairs I ordered worked properly.\n",
      "I'm not satisfied with this item. Its too bad. I couldn't use it more than three days.\n",
      "fine, expensive, but they work ...\n",
      "They work perfect!\n",
      "Terrible earbuds. Poor quality sound\n",
      "Not as advetised.  Not Apple oem, or new case.\n",
      "Fake one! Fake! Fake! Really bad quality.\n",
      "I'm great grateful\n",
      "Really good product\n",
      "The LEFT ear fell apart within 2 days of use, so you may want to reconsider because its of POOR quality\n",
      "Nothing more nor less than what I was expecting\n",
      "Only one side works they break fast.\n",
      "Apple always makes great products. They work, they last and they are reasonably priced . Definitely reccomendation for this product.\n",
      "These earphones are one of the best I've ever used bass is great sound is great. I have no problem with them they are perfect. Definitely would get another pair.\n",
      "Good to use in Apple products. Not for other Phones\n",
      "As expected\n",
      "These are in no way Apple Earpods.  The materials are substandard and the sound quality is poor.  Don't be fooled.\n",
      "It broke one side after two weeks use.\n",
      "Had them for almost a week before one of the ear buds failed. This is the second pair that have done this.\n",
      "This product stopped working after two weeks of light use. This is not Apple earbud quality, they are cheap knock-offs that break easily. Not worth half the price of regular Apple headphones. I have bought cheaper earbuds from other manufacturers that have lasted at the very least 3 months, while these did not even last past two weeks.\n",
      "I dont wanna give any star for it, because it is a fake product. It is not really apple earpod, and the quality is so bad. Dont buy it! You Will REGRET!!!\n",
      "Only one earbud worked very disappointed and will only buy from the apple store from now on\n",
      "fake\n",
      "Really like it. They stay in my ears well, and the build quality is good.\n",
      "piece of s***\n",
      "The headphones was working at the first 3 or 4 times, but then the right side wasn't working at all. Bad quality.\n",
      "Good product. Long shipping though.\n",
      "The Ear buds are great!\n",
      "Loved them!\n",
      "Excellent\n",
      "Replacement for a lost set. Nothing spectacular about them but they work as expected.\n",
      "These headphones sound great and I've pulled them out of a washer full of water and put them back in my wet pant pocket and dried them and they still worked great. And I washed and dried my other pair twice but they couldn't survive getting caught in a bike sprocket :(\n",
      "I waited a whole month for these and they are Completely garbage. I want my money back. The sound is muffled and you can't use the microphone.\n",
      "These didn't work when they arrived. The remote switch for volume doesn't function. Only the mute works. You have to unplug them from the phone If you get a call,while listening to music. I will never purchase from this seller again.\n",
      "I have had 3 pairs of Apple EarPods previously (pesky coffee cups) and am a fan of the quality.  However, I found these to be awful.  Distorted sound, too much treble, not enough bass.  I ordered 2, and both were the same poor quality.  I could not send them back to this seller quick enough.\n",
      "thanks for the item.\n",
      "CRAP!\n",
      "Definitely fake. I was duped. Don't buy it!\n",
      "Gave out within two weeks. Were all bent with creases when I first bought them. They aren't the quality apple products usually given to customers. These have to be the defective ones.\n",
      "Terrible terrible fake earbuds. One didn't work, and the quality is awful.\n",
      "its defanutly the best for the price, and the supply is trustworthy, i had no problems with them which is saying a lot because ive had problems with pretty much every dealer ive gone threw. as far as quality there good for low key main stream bass. i wouldnt recomind for any non main steam because they do some weird stuff sometimes. ive also noticed with listening to orcastra heavy pices or just straite up orcastra compulations it cant handle higher regesters as well as some others.... but for the price who cares, if you want higher quality you shouldnt be expecting anything under 40.\n",
      "Shorter wire, bigger remote control. Works good.\n",
      "One headphone did not even work.\n",
      "DO NOT BUY, bought this through a dealer that has Fulfillment by Amazon and got fake product with shorter cord, a cheap remote with awful sound quality\n",
      "Awesome for the price\n",
      "Awsome\n",
      "Good headphones for the price. Bought some beats right before these and returned the beats.\n",
      "Excelent\n",
      "Genuine OEM.  I like these because you have not only volume control but can pause, play and skip as well.\n",
      "After just a few weeks of use, the right bud sounds lower than the left one.\n",
      "When I plug them into apple products they work fairly well--even the bass is sufficient in the use, which is something that is considerably important for me. The main complaint I have is with the shape of the \"EarPod\" which becomes increasingly uncomfortable with time. I should warn, however, that they are not very compatible with Android, and that's saying it lightly. If you want to use this for an android device, I strongly suggest you buy something else--like Skull Candy, but that's my preference. if you do buy this for an android, chances are, everyone around you will hear your music/videos as well because it plays aloud along with in the Earpods. To make that experience even better, the volume of what ever you are listening to fluctuates often and you lose that coveted bass in the song. Not to mention when you make or receive calls, only one ear is normal volume and the other gets really low and rather than speaking through the microphone as it should, you have to speak through the mouth piece of the phone, so you are pretty much getting the same experience as the phone... only it's not to the side of your face and it's directly in your ear because of the one ear bud. The point is, that these Apple Earpods are very Anti-Android--which makes sense since they are their competition. I've only made the mistake of using it with Android because I lost my iPod and my Skull Candy headphone broke.\n",
      "These headphones were damaged when received.  They still work for the most part, so I kept them\n",
      "Fake, not the real earbuds, I but bought 2 and both were nothing compared to the real ones, considering I have a pair of the real ones\n",
      "Great\n",
      "Outstanding Experience!\n",
      "Wish I would've read all the reviews before buying these. Sound quality was terrible and they broke on top of that on the third day. Worst of all, the seller told me he would send a new pair twice, yeah right...\n",
      "This review is for any cheap knockoffs sold through 3rd party sellers fulfilled by Amazon.  I wasn't paying attention when I ordered and what I received was a white string of lies.  Here is everything wrong with my pair:\n",
      "Horrible not apple don't recommend buying.\n",
      "Not the real thing. Should have read the reviews first.\n",
      "These were complete garbage. I purchased 2 pair and it sounded like I was listening to music under water. Not only that but 1 set broke after 2 weeks of use and the other never worked to begin with. FAIL\n",
      "These are not real (100%) apple iPhone 5 headphone.\n",
      "Its nice, they work fine.\n",
      "It's not worth for money. Mike and volume controls are not working :( . I am going to return it\n",
      "These feel fake.  The center button was DOA and the sound is not great. Am I missing something here?\n",
      "first off....I'm pretty sure these headphones are fake, and I'll get to why I think that\n",
      "Ordered these thinking these would be the same like the ones that came with my IPod Touch. Do they? No they don't not clear at all the switch on it does not work feels very plastic they are comfortable but I don't believe these are from Apple as it said ordered from JACKONE so I don't know but I'm glad they were marked off from $30 to $12 as it wasn't really a waste of money but I will never buy from here again.\n",
      "My package arrived on time.  Upon opening, the case that holds the headphones was cracked and crushed. The headphones were intact. Using the headphones, the mic cuts out a lot and I cannot really use them as I intended, as hands free phone device. They work pretty well as headphones, but they cut out sometimes.  Next time, I will spend the money and buy from Apple.\n",
      "Fell apart almost immediately. Not worth the money.\n",
      "Costumer service couldn't have been better\n",
      "great condition\n",
      "Left ear bud broke and Apple said these are not real.\n",
      "They work as earphones, but they are not at all like the ones you get in the Apple store. They are tinny and sound wrong. They were disappointing.\n",
      "Broke 2 days after purchase. Could of bought these at the dollar store\n",
      "I wear these to go to the gym, and they do stay in place better than my old design Apple set. Also sweat resistance is a plus for me as it was the reason I had to do away with its predecessor. The sound is very decent, very similar in quality as my original Apple. I personally don't like the earbud-type headphones, and these can't be beaten for the money. The color options are a nice touch.\n",
      "I've been using these for a few weeks now and so far they're great. Good quality and the volume/pause&play/skip controller works great\n",
      "These are fake, not actual Apple headphones. Broke within a few days.\n",
      "love these earbuds!!! work great and great quality\n",
      "amazin\n",
      "These are definitely headphones. However, they were neither new, nor in tact upon arrival. They appear counterfeit, or at the very least, extremely weathered. Don't cheap out and buy these when you can get the real thing for almost the same price.\n",
      "These sound much better than the older ear pods that came with my iphone 4s.\n",
      "I bought a set for my some about a month ago and they are already broken.\n",
      "Purchased from Amazon, not a third party so they are made by Apple. I normally don't like EarPods but these are very comfortable and stay in my ears.\n",
      "Terrible\n",
      "The earpods came within the time they said it would be delivered. They fit just like my other ones and sound just as great as the other ones! Will never pay full price for them again after the last ones died on me really fast. They're Apple just as stated in the description. I'm very happy with my purchase.\n",
      "Works just like the original headphones that came with my iphone. What more could I ask?\n",
      "it is a fake.\n",
      "Perfect\n",
      "I received my Apple Ear Pods today and they are working great so far.  They were shipped from China and arrived within expected timeframe.\n",
      "Sounds great but remote doesn't work with android and sometimes slips out of ear.\n",
      "Accurate depiction. Quick delivery.\n",
      "This was an absolutely terrible product. The sound quality was so bad. Maybe I just got a bad set?\n",
      "nice one  i like this kind of EarPods\n",
      "wonderful for the price.\n",
      "Works as intended\n",
      "Great product, excellent customer service!\n",
      "As many of you I guess, I was uncertain if these EarPods were the real deal, I spent 30 minutes comparing these to my old EarPods which I decided to change because the left one was starting to fail, I am 99% positive that these are the same EarPods that come with original apple products, the bass, the depth of sound, everything is there, and it was way cheaper!, I highly recommend these.\n",
      "Arrived fast and work perfectly.\n",
      "These are NOT genuine Apple headphones.I made the mistake of not using them right away(I purchased them for an upcoming trip)& I missed my return window.They didn't work correctly from the moment I opened them.They are cheap & flimsy.I have the genuine Apple headphones & the weight of the cords is much heavier.These were bent & caused crackling from the moment I tried them. DO NOT purchase these!\n",
      "The audio quality is excellent. Surprisingly low base and very clear and transparent mids and highs. I was blown away by the improvement over the previous versions.\n",
      "Ecxelente\n",
      "They're great\n",
      "Counterfeit knock-offs of the real thing, shipped from China (which took 2 weeks). Horrible sound quality.\n",
      "Beware! Do not buy this item. They are not the Apple EarPods as advertised. They are the old Apple earphones. Well, that is not the worst part. The earphones I received was clearly a used one! It still showed stains on the cord. I will be returning mine right away.\n",
      "Item came on time and are original. Did not come in original packaging but was clean and does its job.Fantastic headphones.\n",
      "All I have to say is that these ear pods do what they are supposed to do and at a good price.\n",
      "Sound quality on the ones I received is poor.  I suspect these were either factory rejects or refurbished because other identical earpods are much better.  Will definitely think twice before ordering from this vendor again.\n",
      "Only one earpiece has sound.  I need to return this item asap for exchange please...\n",
      "Died within a month. Would not buy from them ever!\n",
      "Immediately taking these headphones out of the case, I immediately noticed they felt lighter than my previous set.  The cord was thinner and the \"clicker\" was more flimsy.  The sound quality is much poorer and the parts began to fall apart after 2 days of regular use.\n",
      "cheap material, easily broken, sound quality not too good either.\n",
      "There was a shortage .. They only work in the right ear ... (._.)\n",
      "NOT Apple, false advertising! I've purchased four different knock-offs and finally admitted they're are so much less than the Apple OEM because they're cheap! So I came to Amazon thinking they would carry the real thing and did a really stupid thing, I took the word of the product title and didn't read the reviews.  I was in a hurry and thought I could put my faith in Amazon, but that won't happen again. The money I spend on this one pair of head-phones was more than I spent on the other four together...now I'll be spending more buying another pair...from Apple.\n",
      "Pretty good\n",
      "Love it\n",
      "Fake. They aren't the real ones from apple. After using it for the first time it fell apart the listening pice broke off.\n",
      "Came as expected,  and are great quality.\n",
      "Sound great.\n",
      "Product was as described, on-time delivery, and reasonable price.\n",
      "The people that claim these headphones are great are the few who can fit them in their ears. For people like myself who lack this shape of ear, these head phones suck! I can't even put them in my ear and walk a few steps before they fall out. A FEW steps. what bothers me about these is that Apple doesn't even consider the other more universal options when making these headphones. Instead, I have to cram them in my ear for support, damaging my ear. I love Apple, but I'd like to see them consider every one else when making headphones for the masses. Sure, the sound is probably great since my ears are bleeding when I wear them.\n",
      "Great earphones! Fast delivery!\n",
      "the sound is really bad,BAD, BBAADD\n",
      "They arrived broken and we're not even close to being Apple ear buds. Do not waste your money, you will regret it.\n",
      "Excellent!\n",
      "These  EarPods are working just as described and the cost was the best I have found.\n",
      "They seem to be real earpods to me. However, the package didn't include the original box, so that was a bit of a bummer.\n",
      "The one I purchased was used.\n",
      "Looks good but they only worked 2 days. Thankfully, I was kindly refunded my money, no fuss.\n",
      "THIS IS THE MOST HONEST ANY REVIEW WILL GET! PLEASE READ IF YOU CARE!\n",
      "These arnt real Iphone earphones. feels like there gunna brake within a week. #gotfanessed\n",
      "great product for the price\n",
      "Packaging was secure and Shipment was quick. Only 4 stars since the volume button doesn't work on my LG Volt and the cord is a little short than my old earphone cord, but sound quality is great!\n",
      "Thanks\n",
      "Fits my ears nicely. Sound quality is great. Can't go wrong with this one!\n",
      "Excellent sound! So glad I got this brand.\n",
      "Apple did great engineering work with this model.\n",
      "Broke after about a week and a half.\n",
      "Headphones were not original.. Cable were thin... Microphone broke after 2 months of use... Very delicate.\n",
      "knock offs\n",
      "They work great.\n",
      "not very good quality\n",
      "These headphones are knockoffs they aren't real apple earpods.\n",
      "These are awesome....and a lot cheaper on Amazon than at the Apple store!  No issues with them so far!\n",
      "Genuine Apple product! Awesome!\n",
      "love them! They are original apple, great sound. even bought a second pair!! :)\n",
      "These are not Apple-made earpods. At least the pair that I purchased from seller \"Kobayashi LLC\" weren't. I couldn't even get decent sound from a the headset jack on an airplane because the plug was so poorly made, then after barely three weeks of use the earpod popped right off the cord. Buyer beware.\n",
      "they are not original earphones. Already one earphone is not working.\n",
      "Hands down better than the earphones I have been using for a couple months. It is absolutely worth buying it here than buying it from the actual Apple store. You pay half of what you would pay at the store. The sound quality this thing gives is a real nice and the mic is great also. If these were to break down, I definitely would buy another one.\n",
      "Very satisfied with my purchase! Thank you.,\n",
      "OMG these are the most comfortable buds for those wanting a corded device. love the control panel on the cord as well as the length.\n",
      "I bought this for me and my boyfriend, one came broken and one was perfectly fine. I left a bad review since he took awhile to reply back, but he was willing to ship me another pair, I thought that was pretty nice! Overall, the headphones are nice and comfy.\n",
      "Be advised ***if it's from AirWish Inc, they are fake*** but even worse ***they don't have a mic*** (Talk about false advertising)\n",
      "For the week that they lasted, they sounded good and worked well. After a week, the sheathing pulled away from the strain relief on the plug exposing the wires inside.\n",
      "Good product ~\n",
      "Not made by Apple but a knock off, look good but don't work good.  Don't waste your money,  I am very surprised that Amazon allows fake products to be sold\n",
      "Works perfectly. Delivered as promised.\n",
      "I love them.\n",
      "Crap started falling apart immediately\n",
      "these are not real apple headphones..constant buzzing and lousy sound...want a refund asap\n",
      "One thing is for certain.....Apple made these little ear buds perfect!!!!  They fit comfortably in the ear, considering they are made of plastic alone, with no silicone ear bud. But this makes them a ridiculously easy, no-nonsense set of earbuds! You will never have to worry about losing an ear piece!  The quality of the ear buds surpass the few sets that I've purchased elsewhere. And the little remote has more features than any other earbud I've had....you can summon and talk to Siri directly, you can change volume, and you can easily skip and repeat songs! My other earbuds have this last feature in the remote but inconveniently do not have the volume feature!  What the?!? Apple offers the all-around package with these little guys!\n",
      "I love them!\n",
      "is not oryginal\n",
      "Wow! I thought this were REAL APPLE earpods but theyre not this feel way cheaper the sounds is nothing loud .. it comes in an apple earpod case but it looks like its been used and wow just terrible ...\n",
      "My son chose this product for us.  Surprisingly inexpensive for an Apple product.  I needed headphones and it was a great choice.  I would use this seller again.\n",
      "Nice deal!\n",
      "Defective product.  Left side ear biud dead out of the package.\n",
      "The headphones are great! Hands down these are my favorite headphones that I've ever used. However, when I bought from this seller (chubbiestech) the headphones were listed as new, and I've never seen new headphones that were scuffed up like these are. It looks like someone dragged them over gravel on the back of their motorcycle, it's so bad. Because they are so scuffed, when they are in my ears they itch and feel uncomfortable. I can't believe I paid so much for these.\n",
      "Ordered two ear phones. but these are not matching in quality with Original iPhone ear phone. But it is worth with the price I received.\n",
      "First off, these headphones are not authentic Apple EarPods. They look very similar but are much worse in quality, and the earpieces are not fixed; they rotate. These are the two clearest signs that they are not the product advertised. In addition, upon opening the package, the left earpod had a lot of static that made it annoying just to listen to music, and within 2 days, the earpod was not working at all. I will most likely end up purchasing the headphones from Apple (they come with free shipping online).\n",
      "I decided to go for cheaper headphones, and got exactly what I paid for. The sound quality is not very good. After I bought my iPhone 6, there is a noticeable difference between the set of headphones and the factory headphones. The factory headphones are far superior the miss knock off. The sharp edges of the holes inside the earbuds nearly gave me a cut on my ears.\n",
      "They're okay, nothing special.  These darned things are forever lost or 'borrowed' by my adult kids.\n",
      "I like these headphones, even though they are not official apple earpods,which sound much better, I still enjoyed these. The reason im giving these 3 stars is because this product was TERRIBLY made. They broke after a weeks use. All I did was put it in my pocket and the speaker popped out. Point being, good headphones, terribly made and cheap.I'd rather buy the more expensive official earpods.\n",
      "Same quality as the one in stores. But... i paid more than the cheapest being sold. The cheap ones are fake the more expensive ones are most of the time legit and what online buyers really want.\n",
      "they aren't Apple headphones, they're knockoffs.\n",
      "They broke within a week\n",
      "NO!!! My earpods came with one earpiece not functioning properly\n",
      "Excellent\n",
      "These headphones are great. Just like the original ones that came with my iPhone.\n",
      "Not so sure these were genuine Apple...the left earpod came off after a few weeks of light use...  Sound was good though\n",
      "Works great!\n",
      "This is not the original Apple product and they should not advertise it as such.\n",
      "These fit the exact same as my EarPods but sound completely different.  There is absolutely no bass and the general sound quality is very poor.\n",
      "The earpods are fine and the quality is very good, but the volume control near the mic didn't work at all. It was probably a damaged piece. I ended up returning it.\n",
      "Perfect\n",
      "I thought they would be a cheap knock-off for the price but they seemed legit and worked perfect!\n",
      "Exactly what I needed!  Good qualtiy.\n",
      "Good deal\n",
      "For the price, this is a great product. The sound is terrific and they are comfortable. I feel I made a good choice.\n",
      "These look just like the Apple ear buds, however, the performance didn't satisfy me because they simply didn't work! I plugged them into my phone and it just made a slight rattling sound instead of playing any music. I plugged in my other ear buds and they worked just fine; however, these ones did not! I hope to be able to get another pair sent out my way. I may have just gotten a bad pair.\n",
      "Good quality, looks and works just like the original one.\n",
      "Very bad quality. Seems like a 1 dollar Chinese made product\n",
      "It was not an Apple product they were fake.\n",
      "Thanks\n",
      "Well that's what I get for purchasing discounted 'Apple' products online. Only one bud worked and it was going to cost more to ship them back for an exchange than what I paid to start. Total loss.\n",
      "Apple shells with some other insides and cord. The cord is thinner than the real apple and mine is split open in one spot. I do audio for a living, and IF Apple puts dual drivers(and I don't know haven't looked) these are definately not. They have a thin midrangy sound that super sucks. I can't stand listening to music on these they sound so bad. These work for talking on the phone and others haven't said they sound bad on the conversation. Soooo. You get what you pay for, huge surprise.....\n",
      "Received my order with in 10 business days and the packing was very fragile and it works good till now and I hope it does for a long time.\n",
      "One ear was already not working when I got it even though the seller claimed they were both tested and working.\n",
      "They were great, but they broke in a day after they fell on the ground.\n",
      "Excelent.\n",
      "I don't know if these are real Apple brand but my review is for the real brand because mine came with my iphone6. I hate these! They don't fit my ears. They cause a lot of pain. I can only wear them for maybe 10 minutes before I can't take it anymore. I think my ear canal is just too narrow. They don't even seem to sit correctly. Fall out very easily too. I wanted to like them. But if you are a smaller female these might not work for you.\n",
      "Work fine\n",
      "Just received another pair amazing I'm in love with this\n",
      "Can hear fine, but people often can not hear me speaking to them unless I hold the cord holding the mic close to my lips.  Tends to defeat the whole design.\n",
      "they worked\n",
      "i havent decided to buy these yet,but to everyone else who complained about these not being the real apple earpods its probably because you bought the colored version which are not the real apple earpods. the real earpods only come in white\n",
      "These stay in my ears and work great.\n",
      "Brand new just as advertised\n",
      "Excellent product !!! Apple brand and works beautifully !! exceeded my expectations on high quality and affordable price !!\n",
      "Seems like a knock-off. These don't sound as good as actual Apple earbuds and the volume/play buttons are terrible.\n",
      "perfect quality\n",
      "Worth the price\n",
      "Excelente product it works 100%\n",
      "100% authentic apple earpods super fast delivery!! cant beat it with a stick\n",
      "I was using this product for the first two days just fine, everything seemed to work well. I go in to a skype call and I am told that my mic is not functional. The next day I find that one ear bud just broke off randomly.\n",
      "Very good sound and fits perfectly!!\n",
      "Satisfied\n",
      "Best buy i ever made, they sound beautiful\n",
      "Don't listen to the negative reviews these are legit apple earpods (at least mine are) but they work great. They're great workout headphones as they don't fall out and they're sweat resistant. Don't be fooled by the price.\n",
      "They are good for Apple\n",
      "i like the ear pod but only one side works . if i get a different pair that worked i would be happy and rate this 5 stars .\n",
      "These are the real deal.  I was skeptical but they came in the apple packaging and work perfectly and I have no complaints.  Great price for the product.\n",
      "These were broken when I opened them. The volume button portion was split and coming apart. Also, the feel of the cord and non-smooth edges of the plastic seams on the earbuds lead me to believe these ARE NOT REAL APPLE HEADPHONES.\n",
      "I just received these today in the mail.  The left earphone doesn't work at all.  I tried using it with an iPod nano, which works fine with other Apple earphones that I use for outdoors, and the left earphone was silent.  I ensured the jack was fully inserted into the port.  The right earphone worked fine.  I can't help but think these were refurbished or an impostor.  Now I have to pay to send them back for a refund, ridiculous.\n",
      "Brand new OEM earbuds! Great!\n",
      "Works great and its really iPhone ear pods. Sound quality is superb.\n",
      "Wire disconnected from ear piece in 2 weeks.  I have 3 other sets of these and no trouble. Bought these as a spare. Very disappointed.\n",
      "they broke after 3 days. 100% fake.\n",
      "Terrible sound quality. Dollar store headphones sound better\n",
      "Poor - does not help as an audio device - Can not recommend this to any one even an enemy.\n",
      "I received fake low-quality EarPods from seller Detroit Packing Co.  Made to look authentic, but they had low quality materials and terrible sound.  I wouldn't recommend buying from Amazon as it appears to be a gamble whether you'll get the real version.  If you do order, look online for how to spot a fake and get a refund if they are.\n",
      "They were just what I expected.\n",
      "Not real apple product for sure. they beep when I turned them down and up in people's eat I was talking to\n",
      "They work nice the packinging was even legit the head phone just took for ever to come\n",
      "Very comfortable, and easy to pause and adjust the volume.\n",
      "If these are sold by a third party, they are NOT Apple earbuds, they are cheap chinese knock offs that feel nothing like the original.  The sound is tinny and awful, and it doesn't even sit in the ear properly.  DO NOT BUY FROM THIRD PARTY SELLERS.\n",
      "Purchased, shipped by Detroit. These ear buds are clearly fake, cheap and a knock off of genuine apple branded ear pods. These earpods are nowhere near what came with iPhone. Clearly from the get go, the apple packaging wasn't included with the ear pods. Simply, the case of the ear pods was included.\n",
      "I have been using a pair of identical Apple earbuds that came with my iPhone, and they finally started to wear out so I ordered these. These are NOT APPLE HEADPHONES! They sound HORRIBLE compared to my Apple ones, I compared them multiple times and they are completely different. These are horrible! They sound very tinny and really awful. I am not purchasing 'Apple' earbuds unless they are from the actual Apple website, since you run the risk of getting cheap knock offs like these :(\n",
      "Original earbuds. Love it\n",
      "Excellent\n",
      "the headphones sound nothing like the orginal ones they have no bass to the headphones.Sounds\n",
      "Amazing quality. They're the same exact Apple EarPods!\n",
      "thanks\n",
      "I got my headphones a week after ordering from \"Trendyz\". They came in an unmarked clear case that \"looked\" like an apple earpod case but did not have the apple logo. No serial numbers or \"made in china, designed by apple in california\"\n",
      "These EarPods came exactly as described and in excellent condition.\n",
      "Was good while it lasted\n",
      "Fell apart within 1 week of purchase. While sitting and listening to music, the microphone came apart and now the wires are exposed.\n",
      "It is very nice. However, I received no instructions on how it functions. I would recommend to others.\n",
      "They sound just as good, maybe even better than some of the high quality big headphones.\n",
      "Good\n",
      "Perfect, I can't complain\n",
      "They are horrible and fell apart within 2 weeks. Waste of time and money. I purchased this on Amazon.com and this was one of the worst products they had on the site. I would not recommend these headphones to anyone.\n",
      "Fake\n",
      "awesome. I've had them for about 3 months now, and not one problem has occurred. they're amazing! just like apple headphones. :)\n",
      "It's sounds good but feels cheap\n",
      "Fake item but not bad for this price\n",
      "I just love them\n",
      "I am not an Apple product fan at all.\n",
      "doesn't work the sound is so low you can hardly here anything\n",
      "Good quality and durable\n",
      "My wife uses them everyday.\n",
      "work perfect\n",
      "Great discounted product\n",
      "great headphones for the price I brought a extra for my grandson also.\n",
      "My earphones were said to arrive in two weeks, but they arrived in three days! I'm so happy and the buds are great! Would totally buy again!!\n",
      "This is a scam.  I just received them and if they are genuine Apple headphones I’m Steve Jobs.  I loved the sound quality of the originals but these are atrocious.  They sound so awful I can’t barely stand to use them.  Nothing matters beyond that, but there are other clues too: the buttons feel different, cheaper, and when I got them a tiny filament of copper wire was sticking out one of the bud seams.  They stole my money and sent an unusable knock off.  That said, it’s partially my own fault - I should have known they weren’t really by Apple because they weren’t exorbitantly expensive.\n",
      "Were really late. They were a gift for my friend and she waited and waited and waited. Im just hlad she likes them otherwise it would have been a total bust.\n",
      "Great EarPods work just like the first Apple ones that came with my phone\n",
      "I Honestly can't find any headphones in this price range that are as solid as these.  They are very comfortable, the sound quality and range is good, and the mic and volume control are a nice addition; however I will say that the skip function on these doesn't work well when i run for whatever reason...but that's negligible in my opinion.\n",
      "Perfect working headphones for a good price I loved them (-:\n",
      "Great just as advertised\n",

      "I don't believe this is an authentic Apple product. Feels a bit cheap and something rattles inside.\n",
      "Great price for what you get. I was so satisfied with these I bought another for my tablet. They're authentic and last much longer than all of the other brands I've bought in the past.\n",
      "It arrived today! Tested it out, and it was awesome. Had to order another one right away!\n",
      "I bought these as a gift for my husband, because he liked the Apple Earpods that I have.  Mine, however, ARE genuine Apple.  The ones I bought here on Amazon, although purported to be \"Genuine Original OEM Apple,\" are not.  Genuine Original OEM Apple Earpods come in a nifty little white plastic holder that has the Apple logo on the bottom.  The ones I received in this purchase came in a nifty little white plastic holder that does NOT have the Apple logo on the bottom.  So, that clearly shows that they are not \"Genuine Original OEM Apple.\"\n",
      "Not what I expected. I got these exact headphones with my ipod 5 when I first got the device. I LOVED the brand. They lasted me about a year and a half before they finally failed out on me. I ordered the exact same ones(which were these ones) and I'm not a big fan of them. They are already starting to short out when I touch the plug area the wrong way, and they like to make the volume go down on me sometimes. I am not too happy. As I said, I loved my first pair that came with my ipod. Hate these ones\n",
      "Not as comfortable as previous model\n",
      "Came even quicker than expected. Very satisfied.\n",
      "only one side works\n",
      "Excellent\n",
      "Purchased these as a Christmas gift and she loves them! Very clear sound during calls and pretty good for use with music.\n",
      "Reasonable shipping duration but the item is not working properly. The right earplug doesn't work at all so I had to ship it back. I don't know if I'm getting refunded for the shipping fee, because you have to send it back to China and will cost you almost as the price itself, but they seem open to solve the issue.\n",
      "These earphones could not be worse - they actually create a lot of white noise, to the extend that one cannot have a phone conversation, let alone listen to music or books.  I rarely complain because life is too short, but this product is simply beyond bad!\n",
      "They function very well but the ear piece is uncomfortable.\n",
      "They hurt your ear after a while but the sound quality is alright\n",
      "It was so good in the beginning, but then it had to be in a certain position & only 1 side of it worked best than the other. Now both of them are currently working it's just that if you move the wire in a weird position, one side will probably not work.\n",
      "Just as expected.\n",
      "Work great came in like a week\n",
      "very good quality, excellent sound & fast shipping thru prime\n",
      "My partner bought these because he doesn't like to splurge on skullcandies or any other headphones due to them 'always' breaking. So he buys the cheap ones knowing they will break. These are ridiculously cheap. They are so cheap, even a person who loves cheap ones hated them. They fall out of your ears like you wouldn't believe, and the sound quality is simply disappointing.\n",
      "Seems good so far, are a apple product and function  just as well as the originals!\n",
      "quite satisfied with earpods, also happy wirh with small gift\n",
      "delivered as promised\n",
      "fast delivery, legit set.\n",
      "These Apple headphones are excellent. They provide great sound and fit good. They control sound level/ forward & reverse tracks with double and triple clicks. In Pandora you can skip to the next song.\n",
      "great !!\n",
      "Sounds good, got them on time\n",
      "I have small ears and these are the ONLY earbuds I have ever worn that don't start hurting after an hour of use.\n",
      "I have a Apple EarPods before,but that one is a FAKE CRAP! Really angry for it.\n",
      "A part of the ear piece broke off after only a few days of use, kind of mad. Not sure if these are actually Apple brand earphones but the sound quality is just alright. When used for a phone call they projected a very muddy sound, very unclear. I'm sure there are better ear phones.\n",
      "Rather than getting $5 headphones that we all know are knockoffs, these use materials closer to what Apple uses, but they are still knockoffs. They were alright, and look pretty close to the actual thing, but if upon further inspection and usage…it's easier to tell. I was surprised at how close these are to the original, but they are not.\n",
      "It's bby Apple, so you expect it to work\n",
      "Just like the original at a good price.\n",
      "Great\n",
      "Stopped working after a few months. The volume buttons on the cord stopped working all together and one side of the ear piece stopped working.\n",
      "worked pretty good (like the original) until my dog chewed them up..\n",
      "Very poor. They are not from Apple. They feel like they are worth about $2 and they sound very hollow and cheap. Don't purchase.\n",
      "Work really well. Seem pretty authentic to me as well too.... Haven't had any problems as of so far...\n",
      "These headphones are fake - not a real Apple product. I ordered them on September 4, 2014 and this morning they fell apart (October 3, 2014). The earbuds separated from the wire and are now completely useless.\n",
      "Great quality, don't have any problems with them at all.\n",
      "these are kind of cheap, you can def tell when you handle them.  I would recommend you just go to the apple store if u can\n",
      "These are just as good as the ones that came with the phone originally.\n",
      "the earpods I received were NOT authentic Apple earpods .... they had very poor sound quality, and the volume buttons did not work at all. I was very disappointed, and VERY dissatisfied.\n",
      "What came were not EarPods but EarBuds. Please keep that in mind.\n",
      "No. I ordered original apple earbuds with base n these wasn't the same quality. This second time ordering off amazon and I really am thinkn not to order again. Just a rip odd company's saying they have original things and don't.  I could went to dollar store to buy cheap earbuds as this.\n",
      "It's great .\n",
      "Excellent\n",
      "its not real apple earphone\n",
      "These stopped working a week after I received them. There is apparently a reason they are cheaper than the ones you get directly from Apple.\n",
      "Unfortunately new or used was not specified. The items was previously opened and looks like used though it was still clean and it came in original box.\n",
      "The mic doesnt work on LG G3.\n",
      "You can tell by the cheap feeling clicker, the sound quality is worse as well. They definitely look real though, the apple tech had no problem swapping them out for the real deal when I went into the store. Thanks!\n",
      "apple makes amazing small earphones. I have some and my wife, after hearing mine, had to have a pair for herself. she loves them. The design for the ears is very good too. they fit well with their special shape and are very comfortable.\n",
      "These are NOT 100% Genuine Original Apple iPhone Earphones. Not even close. The sound is tinny and weak. There's no bass and little clarity. Sounds like an old dial-up long distance phone connection. The receiver at the other end of the line has to increase their volume just to hear you. They don't seem like they're defective, just cheap knock-offs and not the product in the description. Maybe for $4.00 they would be ok if that's what you're looking for but say what they are in the description so you don't waste people's time returning them which I did. How the seller can claim Original 100% Apple product on Amazon is beyond me. Ebay you can get away with that but usually not here. Don't quite understand any of the other glowing reviews unless the seller's friends wrote them.\n",
      "it is really original and perfect earpods. I'm really content\n",
      "The audio is a crime. It produces sound, granted, but nothing more.\n",
      "These are the worst, and not OEM, headphones I have purchased.  I have had them for three days and one side has already fallen apart and the speaker disconnected in the earpod. Stay as far away from these \"earpods\" and this seller of fake junk as you can.  If I could have given this product zero stars I would have.\n",
      "These headphones are either fake either 2nd grade and didn't pass Apple final inspection. The soud doesn't even come close to the authentic Apple Headphones that I usually buy at the Apple Store. I'm so PISSED. What a waste of time!\n",
      "FAKE\n",
      "They worked fine for about a week. The volume control on the right earbud cord stopped working completely after the first week. And starting today the music cuts in and out consistently.\n",
      "I LIKE IT. That's it.\n",
      "Merchandise fits description!! Great earbuds to have.\n",
      "Bought from abc super center and they barely lasted a week before the wires near the input pin started to show.\n",
      "Expensive but the best\n",
      "Amazing and REAL Apple head phones (same ones that come with Iphone 5/6\n",
      "I used MEE sets for a while, and now I'm back with this headset.  These ear buds don't fit my ears very well, and they fall out sometimes.  But the sound quality is good, and the person on the other end can hear my voice far better than what MEE headset could pick up.  So I'm happy with it.\n",
      "Exactly as described! Prompt delivery!\n",
      "The earphones were awesome..i really liked the sound quality and the general feel of the earphones\n",
      "Very good and it gives a lot of small presents.\n",
      "It's amazing the lengths that a company based in China, like this one, will go to make you believe that you are getting a \"100% Genuine\" Apple product.  It looks EXACTLY like Apple Earpods, packaged EXACTLY like Apple Earpods, but the audio is dull, unresponsive, lacks deep bass, and is not as loud (at the same volume) as REAL Apple Earpods.\n",
      "Not real Apple Earpods. Within one weak there is already a tear in the cord.\n",
      "These are fake Chinese knockoffs. I trusted the five-star reviews. Those reviewers must not have the real deal to compare these to. The build is cheap and the sound is awful.\n",
      "Not very happy. I question if they are authentic Apple EarPods.  I purchased mine from Detroit Packing Co.  The sound is \"meh\", I often hear a high pitched sound during phone calls.  The switch to answer/hang up doesn't work very well.  Overall, I do not like these and would not recommend them.  It could be that I received a \"lemon\".  It could be that I received a cheap knock off.  I have no way of knowing.\n",
      "Product had crimps in wires and sounded scratchy.  Though not apparent this might have been a previously returned set.  Returned for refund.\n",
      "Sound quality is not the same as true Apple ear buds. Yes the mic and volume button work. They look and feel the same as Apple. But the fact is the sound quality is crappy.  Almost no bass at all. Would not buy again.\n",
      "Found my old EarPods and compared them to these. I do not know if Apple has made any recent changes to these earphones but they are not the same. Having said that, they practically sound the same. Worth buying, especially at this price.\n",
      "These are the worst headphones I have ever had and are not even close to oem quality. They are very fragile and within one week of having them the right earbud popped off and the plastic around the jack has come loose. I would not recommend you buy this product.\n",
      "Cords very short. ):\n",
      "great quality and comes with protecter\n",
      "These are the real deal and really an Apple product and they are awesome, the sound is terrific.  No I am not a jogger so I can't comment on running with them, but I'm totally happy. And the price, compared to the Apple Store....you can't beat it.\n",
      "Perfect!\n",
      "The right earbud stopped working the second day after they arrived and the microphone produces very fuzzy audio.\n",
      "Pros: They work.\n",
      "Terrible pieces. They're knock-off. They don't work good, so I bought an original at Walmart and paid $29 and compare them. They are clever imitation but you can see the difference with original. I returned them without a problem from Amazon.\n",
      "They were horrible! Broke after the second say I had them , plus the audio was very crappy and give out this very weird noise that everyone can here but you\n",
      "only the left side has sound. Ironic because I ordered a pair because only the right side had sound.\n",
      "Poor quality and very poor sound. Do not feel or sound like my other apple earbuds. Do Not Buy!\n",
      "Fantastic sound and you can't beat the price here.  I figured I would try this new design at some point and finally (years later, I believe) I bought some. They really are a great improvement over the old stock ear buds.\n",
      "Headphones came earlier than the estimated 6 weeks. They are really good quality. I would purchase them again. I am satisfied with my experience. Thank You :)\n",
      "OEM is the way to go.\n",
      "Fake.  Not an apple product. First pair I received, only one side worked.  Returned and got another pair. Second pair has horrible sound quality.  Tinny.  Makes popping noises whenever the wires move.  Will be returning for a refund.  Don't waste your time with these.\n",
      "Hoped I would received genuine Apple earbuds, but knew it was a crapshoot depending on vendor.  Case was not what I would expect from Apple (non-uniform plastic and no apple logo of any kind.  Sound was muddy and dull compared to the other reals ones we have around the house.  Returned for refund.\n",
      "great earbuds except they keep falling off\n",
      "Not a legit apple product. Sound quality is very poor. Microphone isn't very loud. Poor product. They fooled me. Don't be fooled yourself.\n",
      "These headphones sound nothing like the apple headphones and aren't worth the money\n",
      "Only lasted me a month. Just stopped working all together. Put a little more money in for a better product.\n",
      "Fake, not in fact apple EarPods at all. Poor quality product, not at all worth the price in which I payed\n",
      "Perfect!!!!!!!!\n",
      "perfect, exactly what i needed and delivered on time.\n",
      "This product sucks! It says that you are paying for a \"new product\", but it was obviously refurbished. When I received the headphones they were in the package, but one of the ear buds was dirty and you can see that glue has been sloppily applied to hold them together. The apple packaging is designed so that the cords can wrap around the specially designed mold in a way that will keep the cords from getting kinked or damaged, but when I opened it I saw that it was repackaged with the cords folded over and sharply bent. My headphones work, but they are all bent and mangled up, and have glue globbed up all over the ear buds (which is not comfortable in the ear). And if they wanted me to believe that the product was \"New\", they at least should have cleaned them off before sending me some dirty ear buds. I suggest purchasing directly from apple.\n",
      "Love it\n",
      "great\n",
      "Sound quality was terrible and broke within 24 hours, fake item\n",
      "Defiantly not Apple brand!!!! Fell apart in a few weeks, buy only from apple store/website or name brand website, don't buy generic....\n",
      "great earbuds as expected by apple.\n",
      "The description says \"remote and mic\" and It is not true for my order. It  shipped from BnH Trading Inc seller and had no problem. The only problem is that I expected an Apple earpod with remote and mic, and the mic is not included. It is the ipod version of the earbuds where the remote is the only thing accessible. It works perfectly and was meant to use for my workouts, so it is not a big deal. My only trouble is that I expected something else for a bargain, but ended up paying the same price of what it's really worth. The description should be updated by the individual sellers, so that we are not caught by surprise when the order arrives.\n",
      "They're knockoffs. They look like the real thing, but check the cord—inferior quality. And the microphone sound quality is horrible. Returning them immediately.\n",
      "Bad quality\n",
      "Exactly what my daughter expected. she can't use no other earbuds except these\n",
      "Someone stole my original pair of headphones that came with my phone, so I found these babies and these are an excellent alternative. Although they aren't genuine they have a great high quality sound. One thing I'd like to note is that the case that the headphones come in was dirty when I received the package, but that's okay. Love these!\n",
      "good sound. great fit\n",
      "Good\n",
      "I gave it a two star because it did work. I have the iphone 4s and iphone 6 headphones. I tried all three listening to the same song. The iphone 6 from apple sounded the best. It was very clear and just sounded great. This headphone sounded muffled and the volume was very low. I had to raise the volume just to get the same sound output as the other two headphones. The controls did work the way it should. The 4s sounded much better than this headphone but wasn't as good as the 6 headphones. I hope it was just the headphone that I received but I was not impressed.\n",
      "These are fakes. If you've ever used the earpods apple sells you can tell almost immediately by the quality of the button and the low low quality of the audio.\n",
      "These are completely fake. Don't waste your time with these knockoffs. Anyone who says otherwise has obviously never used genuine Apple earpods.\n",
      "It is FAKE!!!!\n",
      "These look like and seem to be real Apple Earpods until you actually use them. I took these out of the packaging, put them in my pocket alongside my phone, and later took them out to see that the right cover of the earpod (the ear-shaped part) had actually fall off, revealing the internal sound board and wire. I didn't treat these any different than what I had with the regular earpods. Furthermore, the mic is also god awful. It doesn't pick up your voice as well, makes it sound scratchy, and is overall, just a low quality mic. Also, I had $10 Gummies headphones before this, and the sound quality on those was  better than these earpods. Overall, I'm very disappointed with these headphones, and it is obvious that these are fake. I'm going to try to reach out to the seller and see if these were just a malfunctioned piece, and will add to my review how that interaction goes\n",
      "I use these when I'm traveling so it's nice that they're small enough to keep in my coat pocket. The quality is also good and they don't hurt my ears after using them for hours.\n",
      "Affordable, but with a much better sound than my previous ones. These fit the ear better than previous generations of earbuds, insulate noise away from other people better, and the in-line volume control and pause/play is a godsend. If I want to talk to people or compensate for the difference in song volume, all I have to do is grab a little raised area below my ear and pinch.\n",
      "not the product from apple brand...\n",
      "Absolutely not genuine Apple earbuds. While they look nearly identical, there are some slight differences in the curvature and the sound quality is entirely different. The bass is nonexistent and the treble is tinny. Do not buy.\n",
      "Wonderful. Fast & good product!\n",
      "I have never had an Apple device, but I have always loved their headphones.\n",
      "Good quality original oem product.\n",
      "I've had two sets of these and both of them died within 2 months. One of them starts getting quieter and quieter then its done. Sound quality is good, but I'm never buying another pair again.\n",
      "Background info: I use these to listen to music on the bus and also to make phone calls. I have an iphone 4.\n",
      "The item was a poor imitation.\n",
      "Hello its IPHONE headphones!!! need I say more?\n",
      "Sounds really bad with either my iPhone 4s or iPod nano. I got 2 and they are both bad. I have doubts that these are genuine apple!\n",
      "It said \"Apple\" but do not have Apple sign on the box.\n",
      "Total waist of money. These are poop. They broke after using them twice and they DEFINITELY are NOT Apple. Sound quality stinks and when I tried to use them while I was talking on the phone I couldn't hear the other person. All I heard was this loud ringing noise. Wish I could give it zero stars.\n",
      "Very comfortable.\n",
      "Other than usual loose fit in ear they are great and allow private hearing of Ipad or MacBookAir the way I wanted.\n",
      "ok\n",
      "excellent quality and very good price\n",
      "Great product. Fast delivery. Highly recommended!\n",
      "These are not the real Apple headphones, these are cheap knock offs and feel cheap too. The mic is terrible and the head pieces feel cheap and plasticky.\n",
      "Did not hear back from seller after having issues with the product. My initial comment was removed and I'm hoping that this will stay up.\n",
      "Nice\n",
      "Haven't had a week and the thing tore up.  Worse service  I  have ever received with an order.\n",
      "These where not legit apple earbuds. DO NOT BE SCAMMED LiKE I WAS.\n",
      "Dude the volume control button is not functional.\n",
      "Stop working at the 5th day...\n",
      "These headphones do not work. Sound only comes out of one side. Paid more to order the ones from the United States.\n",
      "Good Sound.\n",
      "They do the job!\n",
      "I buy these for my kids and they seem to last alot longer than the after market ones. Thanks nice price fast shipping.\n",
      "cheap and good\n",
      "Perfect so far!  Exactly as EOM\n",
      "Your standard apple headphones. Was able to get them for 15$ which saves you some money rather than going to the Apple Store. I hate the in-ear buds and the sound quality is amazing for the price you pay for these\n",
      "Just as advertised and at a decent price, nice! Will buy again!\n",
      "Microphones do not work well\n",
      "they aren't real apple earphones and they broke within 2-3 weeks\n",
      "It's ok\n",
      "Good headphones, not so much to say, they look and sound good, but they get dirty real fast and the travel case is really bad and cheap, hope this review help you.\n",
      "They worked very well\n",
      "perfect\n",
      "THESE ARE NOT APPLE!!!!! DO NOT BUY.  They are not what you are looking for.  They sound like I am listening to my music through water.  Terrible product and a horrible scam.\n",
      "they're real, I think I bought a knock off pair before because there as just a lot better. I workout with them and carry them everywhere and they've never disappointed\n",
      "Exactly like the ear buds from Apple.,.,\n",
      "Sound is amazing and the bass along side it makes these headphones my personal favorite.\n",
      "This ships from China and is a knock off product.  The wire is thinner than the legitimate product and the quality is much less.  Do not buy unless you like fake product and encourage IP theft. Note that this was sold by Airwish.\n",
      "I thought that they were not the original ones, but later I listened to them and they were really good no matter what I thought they're sound is really good\n",
      "Not too bad.\n",
      "Great bass on these headphones! That's the reason I bought it.\n",
      "worked out great\n",
      "Low quality of sound, looks like it's likely to fall apart within a few days as well or even give you a nice jolt. Returning promptly.\n",
      "Good ones\n",
      "These are NOT genuine Apple EarPods. They look similar, but the wires feel thinner/cheaper and the sound quality is terrible.\n",
      "Good thanks\n",
      "Perfect product, no damages, no news, only perfect!\n",
      "These were sold as a bulk item but they were new, original, and all tests passed with flying colors.  From sound to voice to voice commands all worked excellent.  Packaging was great as well.\n",
      "Excellent, very good product.\n",
      "Excellent\n",
      "Well made but didn't fit my ears well.  The sound was a bit muffled to the party receiving my phone call.  Works well for just listening though.\n",
      "1earbud stopped working after 2 weeks\n",
      "Have the quality of apple headphones.\n",
      "Gift for Granddaughter.  She loved it.\n",
      "After trying all manner of other cheaper models, came back to this. Reliable clean sound!\n",
      "didnt last long\n",
      "Definitely a good buy at a good price.  These are the actual Apple EarPods.\n",
      "The headphone wire holder is broken!\n",
      "I am admitedly hard on products. I ride a motorcycle to commute to work 6 days a week.  I like to wear headphones to listen to music when I ride. These fit nicely inside my helmet without giving me a headache, however after using them for about 3 weeks the wire has broken, so the music cuts in and out with every bump in the road.  This is my second set of these (first set purchased at an apple store) and the first pair I got over a year of use before the same problem developed.\n",
      "Please. Do not waste you're time with these apple earpods. If you are buying them for cheap. Don't. It's not worth it. Mine came with a shortage and the sound was HORRIBLE. So please, either buy them from the retailer or from a trusted person on here.\n",
      "Great purchase!\n",
      "Would give a zero.... Never were the war buds advertised as used! I order 2 sets and both had ear wax inside the earphones. GROSS! Will be returning. So disappointed. Do your self a favor and order directly from Apple so you know what you're getting--- even if they are a bit more expensive.\n",
      "ear buds were great. My wife was completely satisfied!\n",
      "Quick service, functioning well so far.\n",
      "They're not real Apple headphones. They have the same outer appearance as apple earbuds but the quality is markedly worse than the real apple headphones. I'm buying new ones anyway, so this was a waste of my money.\n",
      "It's best just to go to the apple store website and buy the ORIGINAL EarPods.\n",
      "Awesome!\n",
      "Very happy with these\n",
      "Very nice sound.\n",
      "I have my traigus pierced and these headphones work so much better. I never have a problem with them falling out of my ears. However my first pair broke in about 2 months. One ear stopped working so I ordered another pair. I do think I was a tad too rough with them (ie. yanking them out of my purse) other than that I love these headphones.\n",
      "Really terrible sound quality, sounds like the music is being played through a long echoing tube. I do not think these are genuine.\n",
      "One ear pod was broken so I had to return it. Thankfully everyone on the team was really helpful and I got my full refund back.\n",
      "THIS IS FRAUD - THESE ARE NOT APPLE EARPODS.  You can tell by the feel and performance. Amazon, you should do something about this kind of crap.  It reflects poorly on you too.\n",
      "I liked the old style better!\n",
      "Fake and cheaply made\n",
      "I have 7 sets of official Apple EarPods MD827LL/A. Some were included with Apple iPhones I purchased. Some I bought separately from 3 different Apple or Apple Authorized stores. They all sound identical.\n",
      "Do not buy these headphones. Fell apart as soon as they came out of the box. Managed to snap them back together only to discover the sound quality is horrible.\n",
      "Is this a joke?? Right aftr opening the package, I decided to check the music quality. The right pod did not even work!! WTH? I want my money back!\n",
      "Sound quality really not good!\n",
      "Pros: Surprisingly good bass response for such a tiny driver. Comfortable fit. Mic works great.\n",
      "Broke after 1 week. Do not order\n",
      "Great headphones for the office. Perfect balance between the bass and treble.\n",
      "The ones I received were fakes. They stopped working after 3 days. I bought these because I had misplaced the ones that came with my phone. When I eventually found the ones that came with my phone I found that these had a thinner more plastic feeling cable as opposed to the true Apple ear pods - the Apple cable was thicker and had a more rubber like feel to it. Amazon should be more careful.\n",
      "Very Bad quality!! sounds nothing like apple headphones!\n",
      "El selector de música es un poco duro, pero de resto están excelentes\n",
      "I bought a pair just over a year ago, now the wires are starting to stick out where the two meet. They worked fine until then, now they have to be in at just the right angle or there's no audio at all. Won't be buying these again.\n",
      "These headphones are the worst quality. Not only do they feel different in my ear, they also have horrible sound to them. I will be returning these.\n",
      "I needed these in my life  they are perfect\n",
      "good product, perfect delivery\n",
      "I bought these headphones because my original EarPods got stolen and they took so long to come in the mail and when I finally got them they sounded muffled and seemed to have loose parts rattling inside of them. The next morning I went on morning walk and as I went to put them in my ear, both headphones broke. But I guess you get what you Pay for.\n",
      "Complete scam! The headphones are not genuine. The sound is tinny and lacks clarity or bass of the real ones. The buttons are harder to press and not as responsive. The connector makes crackling noises when moved in the slightest.\n",
      "The sound from these EarPods is very tinny and extremely poor sound quality.  They are nothing in comparison to the sound of the  APPLE EarPods that originally came with my iPhone. I thought I was getting a real product.\n",
      "These are not Apple EarPods.  Don't buy them.  They're really not that good at all.\n",
      "Headphones that came with iPhone 6 Plus were amazing. The in ear headphones from Samsung are bothersome and dangerous. With Apple they have great headphones which don't require you to stuff a piece of electronic deep in your eardrum.\n",
      "Far from 100% genuine apple earphones. Short cord, uncomfortable fit, and average sound quality. Product was shipped in a white envelope with what appeared to be a genuine case wrapped in plastic, not as shown on advertisement.\n",
      "Seem to be cheaper plastic AND the mic doesn't work\n",
      "Fake and uncomfortable. It also brings buzz noise when skype.\n",
      "These are horrible quality. They come packaged as if they are new, but mine were clearly used as the cord was dirty, and there was scratching and inaudible sound when I plugged them into my iPod. Do not waste the money.\n",
      "Sound quality wasn't as good as I've experienced before. Right earbud has something loose inside too.\n",
      "The buds were OK sound-wise, but each bud was made from 2 pieces of plastic that needed glue to hold together.\n",
      "I was super excited to try these but I should have just purchased them straight from apple.  Horrible sound quality, remote is very hard to click. Shame.\n",
      "This item here my friend, is the real thing and i'm grateful to the seller for not sending me fake ones..I've used this for months now and it still looks new, my girl still got her own. Thanx, and will like to do business again sometime.\n",
      "You will not find a better price for the original ones. And it does make a diferrence. It is more durable.\n",
      "good sound, good price, good shipping speed. rich sound quality for the win.\n",
      "Awesome\n",
      "great\n",
      "Didn't last, worked for a month the one side out then next\n",
      "Awesome !! Got my earphones today and they are legit !!! Real iphone earbuds !! Happy girl \n",
      "It hurts my ears...\n",
      "I cannot recommend the purchase of this product.  I don't usually post, but in this case, I feel I must.  You will feel foolish about purchasing this \"too good to be true\" Apple product at this price.  I do.  And now, I will have to pay even more for authentic Apple EarPods because I was duped.  Take my word for it, it isn't an Apple product.  The quality is no where near an Apple product.  The materials scream, \"Cheap!\" and, \"Fake!\"  The sound quality was muffled and the microphone did not work.  I requested a refund and was granted a refund, HOWEVER, the return address to process the refund is in China!  What?!?!  Oh really...?  And what will be left to refund me after the product arrives in China, if it arrives?\n",
      "These are genuine apple ear pods. I put them next to the ones i got from the apple store. There is no physical or auditory difference.\n",
      "Awesome came way before the time n with a screen protector\n",
      "Arrived in original casing, excellent quality. Highly recommended.\n",
      "As advertised, nothing to complain about.\n",
      "These earpods deliver TRUE Stereo Sound!!  Wonderful!!!  They also work with Galaxy 4 Phone (with the exception of the volume control).  I love these better than the one that came with the phone (Dr. Dre)!\n",
      "Good, comfortable (at least to me) earbuds.  Only problem is that after time, the wires tend to become loose and create shorts.\n",
      "Good product\n",
      "This headphone are great...that's all I need to say\n",
      "This is really good. . Looking for few more offers like this.\n",
      "Excellent, would recommend\n",
      "Tough fit\n",
      "The real deal!!!\n",
      "The design of the packaging is ingenious. The plugs are a tad too big for my ears. It's a common problem for me. I had hoped they would be smaller. I would still recommend them. Having the volume control at your fingertips is very convenient.\n",
      "Fake Apple EarPods.\n",
      "Was original and works very well\n",
      "really a bargain :)\n",
      "Great sound and quality\n",
      "Got my Apple EarPods even earlier than estimated! They even added a free screen protector for my iPhone 5s! Very happy with my purchase! :-)\n",
      "FAKE!!!!!!\n",
      "That are amazing but the volume for the remote doesn't work but that are the best earpods I evergot\n",
      "Work greAt\n",
      "These work great. Thank you\n",
      "They work\n",
      "Good sound quality\n",
      "Love them\n",
      "Works great\n",
      "excellent value!\n",
      "microphone does not work.\n",
      "Good\n",
      "The ear phones are great! the  only thing that really makes me mad is that the remote on the ear phones doesn't work at ALL!! Waste of money when that's the only reason I got these ear phones. This reason makes me want my money back that's annoying I can't use it at all.other wise no complaints!\n",
      "Love them! I bought them for my Samsung galaxy s3 because I don't like the ones that come with the phone and I can't use them for phone calls or turn up my music otherwise I love them!\n",
      "Excellent sound quality and also fits nicely into ears, some of the other earbuds have popped out frequently, those don't.\n",
      "Product brand new and were shipped as promised but these are not authentic. The quality of the sound are standard and flat to compare to Apple original product it has more quality as well not as cheap as these one's are. I gave this a three star because it's okay for the price but if you want good quality sound don't buy this. If your a person who loves music this product is not for you because you would not appreciate the quality of music.\n",
      "Not new. Received an open product and don't know if it's real or a knockoff. It was not sealed.\n",
      "Fast shipping, great product all around.\n",
      "He loved it.\n",
      "Great apart from the one tiny small detail of them not being 100% genuine original Apple EarPods.\n",
      "Love this product!\n",
      "Not good. Broke in 3 days.\n",
      "Like original\n",
      "Very good quality.\n",
      "First of all, when I clicked \"My orders\" and pulled up the headphones to review them, they came up as being sold by Luxor&Elegance, but that's not who I purchased these from, even my invoice says Kobayashi LLC. So, I am now wondering about the integrity in general of other Amazon reviewers who did the same thing but never caught the difference. Did they review the right seller/product?  Moving on.....\n",
      "These things are awesome! Great sound. Unbelievable base. Very comfortable fit. I've always loved apple's shaped earbuds (and hated in-ear earbuds which always pop out and feel unnatural)\n",
      "No comment. Good, cheap.\n",
      "These headphone are excellent.  These were the exact earbuds I was looking fior and the price was right.  I have had these for a couple of months and they still work pretty well.\n",
      "Great condition , it's legit, and received it 2 days after ordering! Awesome\n",
      "I really don't know why I ordered these when I lost mine... I don't really like them and they fall out of my right ear constantly, but I couldn't give 'em up.  It was really more of a reflex that took me to Amazon to order them.  I guess that's why Apple is such a rich company.  And Amazon.\n",
      "I was a little leery about these before purchasing, given how cheap they are compared to ones sold by apple. They got delivered today and right when I took them out of the packaging it was obvious that they are a fake. The packaging looks very convincing and similar to Apple's, but everything about the actual product is awful. Don't know how or why this product is listed as \"Apple EarPods with Remote and Mic by Apple\" on here...\n",
      "I bought these because I like the Apple headphones but when I started to the read the reviews for the Earpods I thought why not purchase the new ones? People say the sound quality is better.  They fit right in your ear.  They don't slip out and they are very comfortable unlike the skull candy's that violate my ear! So I purchase this item at a reasonable price ($15 vs $30 in stores).  I have trouble with the Jack.  This may be because I use an android vs an IPhone. Although they work on my friends phones perfectly (also Androids). When I plug the Earpods to my phone the phone doesn't pick it up right away.  So I have to jiggle the cord or unplug it simultaneously.  To top it off,  once it actually works with my phone the Earpods slip out my ears.  Especially when I laugh or talk.  Which is why I gave it three stars. This did come an the original apple case and the sound quality is very good to me.\n",
      "Good. Product and seller. \n",
      "For them being so cheap they are really good ☺ First day I used them it had some problem but then there hasn't been an issue after. Really like being able to fast forward and skip songs and vise versa.\n",
      "All excellent\n",
      "I lost the ones that came with my phone. The fact that I paid for another pair should speak on their quality.\n",
      "Great earpods for a great price.\n",
      "Great product\n",
      "Works great.  Was a great price for apple EarPods.\n",
      "Impressive as always..\n",
      "Good product...\n",
      "I'm very happy. I love this product. Excellent quality, and fast delivery. recommended.\n",
      "It is good . The bass not that perfect but It is less headache after use it like ear bud .\n",
      "After my 5+ year old RCA ear buds FINALLY died, I wanted some quality ear buds that would last just as long as my old ones did. You can't get much better than Apple for quality so I went straight for these Ear pods. I’m always getting my ear buds tangled so the case was an added bonus.  (Although sometimes I do have a little bit of trouble getting the top on right.) Unfortunately, the Remote/Mic will not work on my tablet, Mp3 player, or on my computer. It works GREAT on Apple products however. Not a deal breaker, but a bit of a letdown anyway. The volume of these astounded me at first. Normally I have to crank the sound up half way to hear anything, not so with these. Now I have to keep it below 30% or risk blowing  my ears out. These ear pods have great bass to boot. Aside from the Remote problem, I have no regrets about picking these up.\n",
      "These earpods are nowhere close to the quality of real ones made by Apple, although they look identical.\n",
      "I got the genuine Apple earbuds, and they worked as expected. It's just that I don't like their earbuds since they don't stay in your ear that well and don't have the greatest bass response. You can get cheaper, way better earbuds. Panasonic has some great earbuds that actually stay in your ear and have good bass response!\n",
      "I have one for the office and have given one to my granddaughter.  We are very happy with these earpods.\n",
      "Not the original ones! Audio is significantly worse and the button works really bad, you have to press it really hard to make it work.\n",
      "I'm somewhat torn...on the good side these have AMAZING sound quality for the price. However, on the bad side my ears were scarred from wearing these daily??? It could be that my ears are too small and that caused a bit of friction based on the size of the earpods, but I have to be honest these earpods are not large at all. So, it must be my ears! I would definitely recommend them based on sound quality, the remote and mic features, and price!\n",
      "great sound and very comfortable\n",
      "it's a fake product\n",
      "Love these ear pods.\n",
      "The microphone doesn't seem to be as clear as it could be. But, they do work well.\n",
      "After less than 2 weeks using, one of the earbuds no longer works.  Disappointed, although I would buy Apple Earbuds again. In the past, I've had good experiences with Apple earbuds\n",
      "nice\n",
      "I ordered this wondering if I was going to get a misleading knock off wanna be apple earbuds. And so far I have gladly don't have any major complaint with these earphones. I thought the price was too good to be true but at this point, it fails to disappoint.\n",
      "You can softly depict the difference between the apple one and this one (I bought mine from bluetek). However, they preform and feel great. Let's see how long they last...looks pretty solid!\n",
      "These broken so easily... as to be ridiculous.  The glue holding the 'ear screen' to the 'ear bud' part is essentially non-existent and so the front falls off, exposing tiny wires, which then also fall apart.  These are likely NOT really Apple earbuds, but decent knockoffs.  I bought a pair of earpods from the Apple store... and they do not to 'separate' like these do.  (Again the tiny portion at the very top of the ear bud -- where it joins the 'circular' part of the earbud).\n",
      "work great\n",
      "sell the old stuff and cheat to said it new, not ust one time already. I see twice in there. And the funny thing is they call me on phone said they want me to remove bad comment and give me some gift card.  So, I don't know how many time they did this to other customers.\n",
      "Received them today. It does not come in factory package, you can feel the low quality straight of the bat, and the sound quality is even worse. Returning them right away.\n",
      "Works great!\n",
      "These did not have the mic and no sound from the right earphone.\n",
      "Bought these used, they were definitely knock-offs that stopped working within the week.\n",
      "They are the original, they worked perfect\n",
      "The shipping was fast and the headphones are very durable. I stepped on the and accidently snatched them out my ear at least three times. The price is definitely worth it.\n",
      "They broke within the first week that I got them. And I bought 2 pairs! Hopefully I can still return them because it was such a rip off. Don't buy these.\n",
      "Not actually apple\n",
      "Thanks for the little gift.\n",
      "Love the sound quality of these!\n",
      "\n",
      "Good quality\n",
      "These headphones are great; the price is cheap, they are official Apple products, and they work well.  I have no complaints.  Everything is working fine and I am quite happy with them.\n",
      "Great ear buds with a microphone. I even use it to Skype on my PC and it works fine\n",
      "I grabbed some of these after the ones that came with my mom's iphone 5c broke and once i tested the babies i could already tell there was a negative difference, they sound worse than the ones that come with the phone. Thes are fake or toned down ones but either way dont buy!!!!!\n",
      "Just as advertised\n",
      "Falls out of ear\n",
      "Excelente\n",
      "These are probably one of the worst ear phones I have tried. I cannot wear them for any reasonable length of time because they keep falling out of my ear. One side stopped working after a few weeks. They do not even come with ear buds and the audio quality is okay. You can get far better ear phones for less than half the price of this crap. Stay way.\n",
      "NOT OEM. These look legit except the wires feel cheaper and aren't rubberized like the ones that come with an iPhone. They worked out of box but after a few hours use an earbud completely disconnected. Didn't tear or fray or anything, just came off. Do not buy.\n",
      "Earphones were fake!\n",
      "They were exactly what I needed!!\n",
      "Earpod cracked after one day\n",
      "The headphones works very well and the sound quality is more than adequate. However, unlike what the reviews stated that I read before purchasing this product these headphones are not ideal for runners. The standard pair that came with my older iPhone 4s stayed in my ears while working out better than these and that's definitely disappointing. Still, if you don't plan on using them while running these headphones should do the job!\n",
      "I just received ear buds yesterday.  Earbuds came in an apple box with the normal apple packaging. They work perfectly fine and was less expensive than what I pay for them in stores.\n",
      "Fast delivery! Good as new! Love it!\n",
      "Replaced the ones I washed.\n",
      "Sound is not even in both ears\n",
      "Great!\n",
      "The best\n",
      "The real deal and at the best price I could find anywhere.  Highly recommended!\n",
      "super disappointing,\n",
      "The ones I received were obviously fake, not made by Apple. They work for the most part, except when I press the play/pause button it sometimes activates Siri instead of doing play/pause.\n",
      "Great Apple Earpods, for a reasonable price!\n",
      "These aren't real apple headphones, they look the same but don't feel the same.\n",
      "They are real and they have fast shipping and brand new. Love them\n",
      "The wires are thicker than the cheap ones, so they tangle a little less, and or the wires are easier to detangle. Still, all long wires are a big pain and I can't wait until I don't need to dig the knot of wires out of my purse while my phone is ringing. Also these are good because the earpieces on the cheap ones split open easily (at least in my purse they do), but these earpieces have stayed together so far.\n",
      "Excellent product that is as advertised, arrived in good condition and on time. This appears to be an Apple product and it works great.\n",
      "These are fake - despite the high price. It's quite obvious from the plastic packaging, casing and wire material.\n",
      "They were ok they broke after 2 weeks\n",
      "I bought it . Second use the earbuds broke off.\n",
      "sound is very bad\n",
      "They busted the 2nd day!!\n",
      "Came quickly and work perfectly!\n",
      "Arrived on time and worked great as a gift.\n",
      "I at first believed the remote controls didn't work on these, which is the main reason I wanted them. I listen to A LOT of audiobooks and need to stop & start frequently. It's much better to have a working control on the earphone rather than having to reach for my iPhone every time I need to pause. I was going to return these, but after receiving a really nice apology from the seller for the problem, I thought of another reason the remote might not be working. I tested my theory, that it might be my water-resistant case... and when I took it off - the earphones worked perfectly. So I cancelled my return & am re-writing what was a negative review into a positive one. Not only is the headset fine, but the customer service is exemplary in my opinion! Oddly, after removing then replacing my case - NOW the earphone remotes work with the (Lifeproof) case on. Maybe I just didn't have the screw-in jack tightened enough. Happily Satisfied.\n",
      "Love these headphones they don't give out as easy as other headphones. I've had mine for two years and they just gave out. Probably because I let my brother borrow them. But still awesome headphones.\n",
      "The sound quality is excellent. They were well worth the money.\n",
      "Do not buy these headphones they are worthless!  In less than 2 weeks the headphones already broke.  To make matters worse the button on the headset would get stuck so you could not even use these to listen to music let along adjust volume or speak on the mic.\n",
      "These headphones sound awful and the center button doesn't work. These sure don't sound or behave like the Apple headphones I've had in the past...  Save your money.  I'm sending these back.\n",
      "great item\n",
      "This is the best idea ever to keep you earphones safe away from children and animals , transport them safely .\n",
      "ok\n",
      "Great\n",
      "The microphone does not work! I bought these because I lost my headphones but they are not the same quality.The headphones work okay. The sound quality is normal, but not great. Very disappointed.\n",
      "Works well.\n",
      "SwEET\n",
      "It's not that good\n",
      "Perfect pods! Great buy!\n",
      "Fast shipping and as described. Perfect!\n",
      "Perfect, of course; but much too expensive.\n",
      "FAKE DO NOT BUY THESE HEADPHONES! GO TO THE APPLE STORE AND GET THE REAL ONES!\n",
      "Good!\n",
      "Gracias\n",
      "These headphones are loud! I love them bc I block out all the unnecessary ppl around me in the city.\n",
      "Just as good as expected\n",
      "The headphones are pretty good. Sound quality is great and they stay in place pretty well, even when working out. However, I did not receive the remote with my purchase.\n",
      "Great product!!!\n",
      "These are  the real thing. I was hesitant to buy b/c people left reviews that they were fake. They are Apple earbuds. I work outside and go through about 2-3 pair a year. I used to buy them at Best Buy for $30. This is a much cheaper option. I just ordered 2 more pair. I wanted to make sure they were real before I purchased several.\n",
      "I just love my apple headphones!\n",
      "These are the real deal.\n",
      "Great earphones\n",
      "exceptionally awkward and hard to use\n",
      "Looked forward to using this product.  However, the right earbud did not work at all and had to return them.\n",
      "They are great!\n",
      "I think these are knock-offs.  It says by Apple, but I am skeptical because Apple products in my experience don't fall apart inside 2 weeks.  The buttons on this \"knock-off\" actually all work properly which is a very good thing in my experience with knock-offs.  My issue is the button thing split in half at the seams and it keeps coming apart, though it still works, but it's only been a couple weeks so it's too early for this sort of issue which I have never seen before.  Also the round white cover by the plug end sometimes slides up the wire rather than unplugging when I pull on it, so I have to squeeze extra hard to ensure it stays together AND unplugs.  Other than that it's a solid knock-off with different issues than what I am used to for knock-offs of these specific earbuds.\n",
      "Works fine - like the original.\n",
      "Excellent sound quality but could they be less ergonomic?\n",
      "Worth the price and the sound is AMAZING\n",
      "nice earphone\n",
      "These broke after a week of use. Save yourself some money and don't buy.\n",
      "They have issues 3 weeks after i received them.\n",
      "I like this ear pods, excellent sound quality\n",
      "Great headphones for excellent price.\n",
      "They sucked!! They broke a day after I got them\n",
      "These Earpods are super!  Dual speakers on each Pod. Custom made to fit right and left ear. High quality sound. Single piece construction, thus avoiding losing \"earpiece tips\".\n",
      "Great price and real apple brand earpods. Packaging was a little dirty, but I am happy.\n",
      "Excelent! Just at time\n",
      "Not authentic apple product sounded tingy with no surround noise dampening\n",
      "These are counterfeit. It is obvious from the texture. Apple ones are more rubbery; these feel more like plastic.\n",
      "Not authentic! Fast delivery though..\n",
      "Amazing quality !!\n",
      "The sound quality is what I was expecting, very good, and the physical quality seems good. I'll need to use them for awhile to determiine durability.\n",
      "Excelente product 100% genuine!!\n",
      "Broke after three weeks. Very disappointed in Amazon for selling junk Apple knock off.\n",
      "The items looks good and arrived much faster than the estimation(but still took 2 weeks)\n",
      "Nice quality at a great price.\n",
      "real earpods that are not fake like other sellers\n",
      "The kiddo said THESE ARE AWESOME\n",
      "These are not apple EarPods.  Sound quality is poor, like you are listening through a tin can.  Very little bass produced as well.  Wish I would have spent the extra $10 and got the real Apple earbuds.\n",
      "Daughter loves them\n",
      "work great  love them\n",
      "Bought these to replace my original earpods that had an unfortunate exposure to an uncoupled DC out from a headphone amp.  These headphones are not \"Apple\" earpods, they are \"Chinese fruit\" earpods; the sound quality is nowhere near the original earpods.  The highs are somewhat clear, not as good as the original but close.  The bass response is distorted and the low frequency range is almost non-existent.\n",
      "Stopped working after one day. Music is only coming out of one ear.\n",
      "very nice earbuds.\n",
      "A great buy and they are the best earbuds.\n",
      "These are not apple EarPods\n",
      "Do not buy these. These are not authentic Apple earbuds. I received them today and tried them out. I could immediately tell they were not authentic earbuds. The sound quality is terrible compared to the real ones.\n",
      "Great product\n",
      "The ear buds are working however the remote is no longer working. I haven't had the earpods long either. I'm disappointed.\n",
      "Good!\n",
      "Cheaper than Apple and work as good as Apple. Came fast in the mail I've had it for over two months and they're still perfect\n",
      "I highly doubt that these are authentic.  I plugged them in, and immediately noticed that the sound was poor.  The high ends in the audio were hard to hear, and in general, the audio was \"tinny\".\n",
      "Exactly what I was looking for.\n",
      "Work great!\n",
      "Totally recommended!!! Worth the price!!! Works awesome!!! Sound quality is amazing! best usable for calls and got it before the Estimated arrival time!\n",
      "1. These are not genuine.\n",
      "WONDERFUL\n",
      "THESE ARE NOT REAL APPLE HEADSETS, OR THEY ARE TOTALLY DEFECTIVE. HORRIBLE SOUND.\n",
      "Husband loves them ... They came quickly. Thanks!\n",
      "The best ear phones i have used till date .. voice clarity and sound is the best .. :)\n",
      "Exactly as advertised. Work great.\n",
      "It work prefect for one week after that it has some problem in mic\n",
      "Great price, arrived in original packaging, very happy!\n",
      "Satisfied with the product - matched exactly the description. Delivery was fast, and it came with an iphone 5 screen protector as a gift :)\n",
      "Good quality headphone at very reasonable price. Bought three pairs!\n",
      "Best price ever!!\n",
      "theI bought these because I liked the pairs that come with ipods I have bought. these are not the same quality, the controls are cheap and after three days of use the wire coating has cracked. I bought two pair, i would return but it is not worth my time. I am writng this review to warn against buying them here.\n",
      "really are the original apple\n",
      "2° line Chinese!!!\n",
      "These are hard to beat for the money\n",
      "I ordered a pair (2 products) to have a spare and I find with surprise that he works only a couple headset, hopefully last me another couple months sufficient, because the product is not cheap.\n",
      "These headphones are fake. The sound quality is bad.\n",
      "These are great EarPods. I noticed some grumbling in previous reviews about the quality, and I just scratch my head. They sound great. Not up to the level of my $80 Klipsch In-Ear buds, but they did not cost that now, did they. They still have very decent sound and bass, and the wires are a site thicker than my Klipsch, which makes me feel like they might be able to take a bit of less then perfect care. I will agree with others that they have a tendency to slip out of the ear, but a pair of EarSkinz fixed that.\n",
      "Awesome\n",
      "These are easily the most comfortable pair of headphones I've owned. The sound is clear and the quality is excellent, with an appreciable level of bass. The buttons on the remote are tactile and responsive and make a satisfying 'click' sound. I would say these are best headphones available for under $20.\n",
      "Awesome ear pods and covers up outside noise.\n",
      "I've had them for a week and they're already broken. Don't waste your money\n",
      "Better sound than the original, but still ear pods.\n",
      "Excellent! Great quality of sound.\n",
      "I think same could be the case with other non Apple mobile phones. However, satisfactory Audio and mic quality.\n",
      "I bought this piece as a gift , they liked it.\n",
      "This product is NOT the genuine apple earpods. Upon opening the package and giving them a listen that will be very obvious. The bass is very much lacking, and the overall quality and feel of this is cheap and junky compared to the real thing.\n",
      "Exactly what I wanted. Seem like the real thing. Came on time and everything.\n",
      "Total Rip off. CHEAP CRAP!. Waste of money, not real EarPods\n",
      "this is completely fake I was so disappointed when I got them do not buy them, at least it should say fake\n",
      "These things are awful don't fit my ears. Sound quality is no better than the $4.99 off brand I bought at Tuesday Morning. Just awful for phone conversations people complain that Iam on a speaker phone.\n",
      "Piece of junk\n",
      "nice\n",
      "Great quality, the same as from Apple!\n",
      "Not like advertised!\n",
      "It is not genuine, my Apple' earpod sound a lot better but it is still good for the price.\n",
      "Love my earbuds! And they were cheaper than buying at Apple store.\n",
      "The pair I received were definitely knock-offs; albeit very well done knock-offs. The cord was thicker and the inline controls much stiffer than the real deal. The sound also had a lot of white noise and I'm not sure the microphone worked all that well as the one call I did make with them others on the line said they could barely hear me. The inline controls also only adjusted volume on my iPhone and not my MacBook Pro; a real deal breaker since I use them more while working.\n",
      "I don't know why people give it one star. I don't know if their really original apple headphones but if their not they are very close sound and bass are perfect and you get no ba sound when you blast them like other bad headphones\n",
      "These EarPods are very fragile and bleed a lot. I've gotten them twice and both pairs have broke.\n",
      "They fit and work great. I received them earlier then time frame given, which was a crazy  amount of time to wait for shipping. Really? A month to ship and receive? Anyway, it took a little over a week to get, and they work like they should. Just concerned how long they'll last seeing how my previous ones crapped out in less then 2 years.\n",
      "Wonderful sound\n",
      "PROS:\n",
      "Not as good as the JVC Gumy's, but ok\n",
      "The delivery was early and it was what i hope for\n",
      "I got my headphones today and they worked really well and came in original packaging! I even got a bonus little gift.!\n",
      "Using these headphones as we speak! Fit great and sound beautifully! Even the microphone works! Great purchase!\n",
      "always worried about getting scammed with headphone and phone chargers, but this one is good. just as good as the set that originally came with my iPhone.\n",
      "Not as they listed, it says apple earpods but their not originals.\n",
      "I recommend\n",
      "The real deal at a great price ... what more can I say !!!\n",
      "It's not an Apple item\n",
      "Broke in one ear almost immediately. Broke in the other ear within another week. I've had apple earphones before that lasted for more than a year, which is why I bought this pair. Something was not right with these.\n",
      "Sound is clear and I can control the volume, not only on the iPod but also on the ear plugs\n",
      "Great! Exactly like the apple store brand! I love it and it's still working and playing my music after a month!\n",
      "Great!! Thank you for an Awesome buy.\n",
      "I like the fit of these earpods.  The sound is superior and they stay in my ears much better than the set that came with my phone when I purchased it from Apple.  I would recommend these to anyone who wears earphones daily.  You will be amazed at the clarity.\n",
      "Sound good, but i compared them side by side with my friend's store bought apple earpods and you could tell his were much better quality both in sound and material. I honestly don't recommend these.\n",
      "Just got these EarPods and the sound is awesome.  Very durable feel, yet comfortable in my ears.  Quite pleased with my purchase!\n",
      "sorry cheap... broken right out the package.  call Amazon.com 20 mins after delivery.  these are no real apple headphones.\n",
      "This product is a terrible representation of real EarPods (clicking buttons, crummy sound, etc.).\n"

      "I am giving them a rating of two because although they are one of the few earphones that actually fit my ears, if you are buying them to work out with - DON'T! First time I ran with them within minutes of my run I was getting little static shocks in both ears as well as whenever the microphone would tap my neck - which was often because, well, I am running.\n",
      "Works fine for the price.\n",
      "The right earbud doesnt work well at all. Very disappointed.\n",
      "First, they came in the mail a month later. Second, they were defective, did not work. Looking at them, they indeed have the Apple sign, but the cables connecting the earpieces are thinner than the original Apple I got for my iPhone. I know this because I lost mine, but not my wife, si I could compare. I doubt they are genuine, may be a nice fake, but so nice that it does not work. Do not buy, go to Apple store instead.\n",
      "Item posted as a new item, but I received an used item with clear signs of previous heavy use (ear wax on the earpiece !).\n",

      "Nice!\n",
      "These are not genuine apple earbuds, even though they claimed to be!!! I purchased these to use along with another pair I purchased directly from an Apple store a couple months before and the volume controls are do not click/work like the genuine apple ones do. DO NOT BUY... in fact Amazon is so rife with fake/garbage quality phone and electronic accessories, which I have unfortunately purchased and been burned on, I recommend not purchasing anything at all is this category from Amazon!\n",
      "Decent! Okay I have to be honest, these headphones are good but not great, what I mean is that they easily break, but that was my mistake. Other then that, these are true genuine Apple EarPods! Loved them while they lasted but if you want the best, just order off the official website or visit a local Apple Store.. Would consider buying again.\n",
      "the best for the price\n",

      "Headphones awesome\n",
      "WORST PRODUCT EVER!\n",

      "Personally I LOVE the design of these headphones but damn are they s***. After 1 week of use after purchase, both sides of the inside speakers stop working. I've never let anyone use them nor damaged them with any kind of substances / water. I'm not sure why exactly but after 1 flawless week of listening to music, the volume on both sides have reduced by 65%. Sucks that i wasted $18 or so on a pair of headphones that become useless a week after.\n",
      "Broke already!\n",
      "Sound is okay and they somewhat stay in my ears. My biggest complaint is the high pitched ringing that comes from them when used in the DualShock 4.\n",

      "as good as the original that came with the phone\n",
      "Frustrating. Will have to return. Remote does not work and on top left ear plug discharges electricity. Scary!\n",

      "These were not real Apple EarPods. It comes in the same white/clear package but the Apple logo isn't on the back of it. You can tell that the material is a lot cheaper than the real ones. When I received my pair the left earbud barely worked. The right earbud produced good sound but it wasn't as clear as real Apple EarPods. Overall, I'd skip these and opt for earbuds with nicer materials and better sound quality.\n",
      "good deal\n",
      "I purchased these to replace a set of EarPods that stop working.  These may be Apple ear pods but the wires are considerably thinner than the originals.  That said, they do perform as expected.\n",

      "Fast shipping, good quality. Would recommend\n",
      "Not great sound quality. Would probably buy the headphones from apple next time - there's a noticeable difference. Even my old apple ones that are broken on one side sound much better, with a fuller bass. This one sounds flat.\n",
      "Same with the previous review. There is always buzzing noise coming from the earpods. It's very irritating. Initially I thought it was because of the quality of the youtube clips but it turned out to be noisy for everything. I regret purchasing it from this vender and will buy another pair at local apple store.\n",
      "THEY WERE BROKEN ON ARRIVAL. DO NOT PURCHASE. GO TO THE APPLE STORE AND BY LEGIT REAL HEADPHONES =[[[[[ WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY AND I STILL CAN'T LISTEN TO MY MUSIC\n",
      "There r buzzing all the time. The sound quality was so poor. I wish I didn't buy it\n",
      "Great headphones. My daughter really likes them.\n",
      "Previously, I complained about how these EarPods didn't work. Turns out I'm just a moron and I had volume limit on. The sound quality on these EarPods is amazing. They're cheaper than most Apple EarPods and the wait is short. Definitely worth it.\n",
      "Received a fake pair not actually manufactured by Apple. It was a convincing fake, but a fake nonetheless. Be careful!\n",
      "Product is very efficient. Works wonderfully and is great with my use on iPhone 5s. Very loud and clear. The mike works perfectly as well.\n",
      "Yes they work great!!\n",
      "Great Stocking Stuffers for the whole family!\n",
      "Just like the original headphones shipped with my phone. Great purchase!\n",
      "These Earpods are great, not sure if they are knockoffs or not but I am very happy with them so far. They seem like the real deal though, and work great with the iPhone 4\n",
      "After purchasing a much more inferior replicate from China, I was very happy with this pair as a replacement. Just like the original pair I got from Apple, so I'll be buying from them again when I have torn this pair up finally.\n",
      "Headphones broke within 2 weeks.Waste of money. Also, I couldn't speak into the mic, I had to speak into the phone itself. I had high hopes but I should have just purchased them from the apple site or store\n",
      "good\n",
      "The headphones work really well. However, I use these for working out and once I start sweating, they start to fall out of my ears. I have to dry them off a lot. The quality of sound is great though. Plus I really like being ably to control the volume from the earpiece. These particular earphones would probably be better off used when sitting rather than being active.\n",
      "Excellent condition ...have no issues so far!\n",
      "Very nice pods. Just like the ones that came with my phone before i washed and dried them. 5stars\n",

      "Are really good headphones!!!\n",
      "Good\n",

      "works great and it doesn't even break easily\n",
      "good like apple\n",
      "yes. Love APPLE. Just like the ones I got with my Iphone 5s\n",
      "Product NOT delivered as described - COMPLETELY UNUSABLE.  They showed up with no sliver headphone jack to plug in....just a bunch of frayed wires at the end of the cord.\n",
      "Their good.\n",
      "Awesome\n",
      "For my ears these ear buds are absolutely the best I've ever experienced.... The way they fit and the sound they produce, amazing....\n",
      "Function as described.\n",

      "They work just like the real Apple ones.  Great quality headphones that can be used to listen to music or talk on the phone.  The built in mic on the headphones works great.\n",
      "I freaking Love These EarPods\n",
      "These are actual apple earbuds :) work great!\n",
      "When first put them in my ear the plastic felt sharp. A week after buying these, they began falling apart with the plastic ear peice complete coming apart despite good treatment. The rubber underneath the ear peice began sliding down the wire as well.\n",
      "Great quality\n",
      "Just as I was expecting it.\n",
      "Just as expected, but better!\n",
      "Opened this package and one earpiece fell apart right away ... And worst enough it won't work. You have to manually apply insane force to get it to work. Worst experience ever.\n",
      "IM IN LOVE WITH THESE EARPHONES GREAT PRICE AND SO COMFORTBLE FOR ALL OCCASIONSWHILE RUNNING LAYING DOWN TO TALK ON THE PHONE !!! THEY ARE THE EXACT SAME APPLE ONES....\n",
      "I had purchased these for my husband and only recently closely examined them for myself. BUYER BEWARE! These EarPods are IMPOSTERS and absolutely cannot be a genuine Apple product. Sound quality is horrible and only plays at normal volume out of the left side, while the right side is much softer and muffled. Seriously: complete garbage! I also compared them physically with my own authentic Apple EarPods and found material differences, namely: a cheaper, shiny, harder white plastic/rubber on the imposter pair. DO NOT buy these if you want the real deal. I recommend purchasing directly through Apple's website to be safe rather than sorry. Come on, Amazon! You need to do better. X((\n",
      "Will shop more often .....\n",
      "Lost my headphones, and these work and fit great! the only down side is that if you are working out these have a tendency to fall out due to the lack of fine grip.\n",
      "Title says \"apple\" earbuds. Clearly are not. This seller is a liar. These ear buds work, but the quality is pretty bad. The quality of these earbuds are equivalent to three through five dollars. The fact that he is selling these for 16 is a crime.\n",
      "I am very satisfied with the time of delivery and the product.\n",
      "Arrived perfectly and they sound great.\n",
      "Exactly what I wanted for long flight. Comfortable, good sound.\n",
      "functions great,but difficult to keep in my ears with hard prolonged exercise.\n",
      "These are real! My old headphones from my 5s were torn to shreds and i didnt wanna pay 40 dollars for brand new ones. These are genuine and cheaply priced!\n",
      "I was looking for \"Apple Ear Pods\" but these were not them. I bought these thinking they were Apple brand but they are cheap knockoffs. The sound quality is bad, the chord is short and made out of cheap material, and it falls apart in a couple days of using them. I am very disappointed in this purchase. False advertising should be illegal.\n",
      "Excellent !\n",
      "Got them and the speaker to change songs doesn't work. It works when it wants and the wire had a short in it so it worked when it saw fit. Also when I'd be on the phone people couldn't hear me because of the mic malfunction\n",
      "great\n",
      "Excellent fit!\n",
      "Comfortable to use, absolutely amazing :) sounds is crisp and clear would recommend getting\n",
      "Best ear buds out there. They dont fall out my ears I can work out.with them they are great\n",
      "Excelent\n",
      "dropped these in the toilet twice and the sound just like when i got them amazing\n",
      "I am about ready to leave Apple to another type of phone. I am kept me so locked into the same lame accessories.  Already I can feel the same thing happening: the plug in area of the cable is already showing promising signs. that, it will need to be replaced again, in a matter of months.\n",
      "I give this one star for working but very disappointed because they are in fact not \"genuine\" OEM apple ear buds. They are a decent copy of the real apple ear buds but anyone who knows apple products could tell.\n",
      "Super Fast Shipment, Great Price\n",
      "Great product however a bit expensive. Otherwise, works well and arrived on time.\n",
      "These are counterfeit. The sound quality is terrible in comparison to my old apple EarPods which says a lot since my old ones have been through the wash and have a partially broken wire. Waste of money if you care how your music sounds.\n",
      "these headphones are the real deal. When I see claims of items being original equipment manufacturer on Amazon at times I get a little skeptical but these really turned out to be the real deal and my wife loves them\n",
      "Good headphones\n",
      "Perfect\n",
      "Absolute scam.  Headphones were falling apart immediately.  I ordered two of them and neither lasted a week.\n",
      "Loved the style however they wore out after a couple weeks.\n",
      "Good product. Good sound.  Definitely replaced my old pair with this fresh new pair.\n",
      "one set is already broken!! I am so over buying apple headphones and chargers that last a month at best.\n",
      "Great\n",
      "Great and on time.\n",
      "The head phones lasted for a week or two before I started having problems with the sound.\n",
      "It's fake Don't buy it.\n",
      "Bought 2 of ear pods, 1 of them had a pinched cord and did not work. Very disappointed in the company, u could obviously see that the cord is defected b4 u package them. I been a amazon customer for many years and i have been having more problems with whatever i order. Gonna have to rethink if i will continue as prime customer. Its becoming more of a hassle.. Overstock i think i might go back to u...\n",
      "I had honestly expected to get these today (August 28) but they actually came a couple days early. These headphones are EXACTLY like the ones that I had gotten with my iPhone 5C. They sound great, the buttons work perfectly fine and I can still access Siri from these. There are perfect!!!\n",
      "These are Fake, do not Purchase.\n",
      "Perfect so far! They were shipped out to me extremely fast! And they work wonderfully.\n",
      "Fake !!!!! Not the real thing.\n",
      "They fit well and the price is right. Would buy them again.\n",
      "Love it !!! Exactly what I ordered\n",
      "Good\n",
      "I've read that a lot of work went into the design for the current Apple ear buds, including a biometric analysis of hundreds of pairs of ears. I guess mine must be defective (my ears, I mean) because they just don't work with the shape of the plastic \"buds.\" One I get them into my ears, I have to twist them (the buds) in order for the main speaker port to fire directly into my ear canal. Once they are twisted in place, and the speaker cables are sticking up in the air at a ridiculous angle, then the sound is quite good. My advice to prospective buyers is, borrow a pair from a friend. If you're lucky, they will fit the way your ear is shaped. If your ears are like mine, you'll want to choose from the hundreds of other great ear buds on the market.\n",
      "Cheap and broke within a week -_-\n",
      "Worth the money.\n",
      "I love the one I had with my iPhone 5c then it broke & I wanted to find the same one for a cheeper price. They're just the same and came really fast.\n",
      "Broke on first use\n",
      "Good price and work great!!!!!\n",
      "I initially bought 2 sets but only received one. I made one phone call and immediately was sent a follow up email from vendor. I received the second set a few days later. I believe it was a simple mistake. Im good!\n",
      "one side already damage on second use\n",
      "Very nice 1/3 the price of the same from an apple store\n",
      "Fits my ear perfectly, sounds great .\n",
      "Son loves these earpods. They don't fall out and the sound quality is very good.\n",
      "love it\n",
      "I am happy with the product\n",
      "I love the bass of these headphones its like listening to songs with bass subwoofers but the bad is there not noise isolation but its worth good for the price and good to use when ur talking onthe phone\n",
      "These earpods are of great quality. Just like the older ones I lost.\n",
      "Sound is good. I am very much satisfied\n",
      "They sound great but they came with a broken mic and volume buttons. They came in a apple carry case so there is no reason they should be damaged, the sound quality is amazing and fits in my ears perfect. I think they are refurbished earpods\n",
      "Thumbs up\n",
      "The sounds are clear and they work just as well as the originals.\n",
      "I can't live without these, these are my second pair after losing my first, best sound ever\n",
      "So the earbuds themselves do not have nearly as much base as the real apple earbuds but have decent sound quality for the price. The volume control seems to be off, not sure how but my real apple earbuds don't flex as much. The case is defiantly not an apple case the real deal has the apple logo embossed on the back, which this case does not.\n",
      "The seem to be legit Apple ear buds. I love them and they work great. When I first started using them they hurt my ear, perhaps I have small ears. I stuck with it because I liked the sound quality and now I can wear them forever without any discomfort\n",
      "Great headphones! Very happy with the product! Great sound quality. Arrived very quickly!\n",
      "They fit well but they are starting to deteriorate after about a year of use\n",
      "Great headphones and great price and fast shipping.\n",
      "The earpods work fine but the remote to turn the volume up or down doesnt work however I am able to answer or make calls.\n",
      "i like it\n",
      "WTF??? I got it and it was so dirty, with someone's earshit in the earpods!!!\n",
      "Good!\n",
      "Excellent sound, crisp and clear, the one that I received was perfect. I love using these while traversing here and there without having to hold the phone to my ear, it also makes it easy to listen to music and skip songs while running, or biking. I will have to order another one though since my kitteh has chewed up this one :(\n",
      "Created a \"HUM HUM HUM HUM HUM\" noise when plugged in and music playing. Clearly a chinese knockoff. Instant return.\n",

      "It works how I expected it too at a good price\n",
      "They produce a good sound for listening to music etc, but when it comes to using them to talk on the phone, I often get complaints about sounding muffled.  It is also a little obvious that they are not \"real\" apple ear buds.\n",
      "Very Nice!!!\n",
      "Great earbuds, exactly as described.\n",
      "Best price out there for these earpods. Authentic, fully functional, and exactly what I wanted.\n",

      "So much better than the old headphones!\n",
      "They are the real deal and am happy I paid a lot less for them!\n",
      "I do not think these are very good quality earpods. I do not think they were Apple product at all. They definitely did not meet my expectations. First thing, it took several weeks to receive the product. They were expensive in price but very poor quality. They were broken within the first week of use. I would not recommend these for anyone.\n",
      "Just like apple's\n",
      "Love it\n",
      "Just as I expected, genuine product.\n",
      "The first time I used them they had a short in them. I debated asking for a refund.\n",
      "I'm usually skeptical about buying headphones online because of all of the generic branding. But I have had the official Apple brand EarPods in the past and the quality of these headphones matches the same as the original apple quality.\n",
      "I love these headphones, however this is the fourth pair I'll be getting since they break easily , but I lost 2 and 2 got broken so..\n",
      "As advertised. Great buy. Super fast delivery.\n",
      "These are official Apple headphones that sound awesome!\n",
      "Used this until it broke from being in my bag and getting squished. Will buy another one because I love it so much! The buttons were so convenient and the speaker worked perfectly. The sound was alright, but I really just wanted it for the buttons/speaker. I loved the fit too -- my ears are too small for the old-style earbuds and my cartilage would always hurt after long periods of use with the old ones. With these ones, I can wear them in as long as I want, even overnight, and they won't hurt.\n",
      "My old earphones gave out on me and I was in need of a replacement. These were great it just sucked having to pay a more than I was used to for earphones but they're worth it. They last and sound great.\n",
      "When my package arrived, I had a defective EarPods. So I contacted the seller and told me that he can either give me a refund or send me new EarPods. I decided to go with the new EarPods. And they got shipped over night and and work awesomely. Everything was nice and smooth.\n",
      "Works great/ Simple and easy\n",
      "Great price, great product, as advertised!\n",
      "Exactly what I was looking for. Tried the wireless variety but the wires going to the earpods wore down so far, they shorted out. I have to admit, Apple put some work into them. From the quality of the protective membrane to the earpods themselves. The sound quality is superior. So glad to do business with this seller. Appreciate getting original product; not a cheap knock-off.\n",
      "These are not real Apple EarPods, they're generic and broke the first day I received them. There's definetly a difference in quality of music between the real and generic version of these headph\n",
      "Fell apart completely after about 2 weeks of having them. Would not recommend at all.\n",
      "Came faster than expected(about 2 days after purchase) good quality jeadphones apple has outdone themselves these are the original ones and im glad i did not get some generic earpods\n",
      "Good\n",
      "These are outstanding ear buds for the price, however, Apple needs to work on the \"comfort factor\".\n",
      "These EarPods are definitely way more comfortable than their last model, which used to hurt my ears after about 20 minutes of using them. I highly recommend this product and would buy them again. 5 stars\n",
      "Excellent product!! Would recommend!!  MCR\n",
      "I can't tell the difference in sound quality like everyone else but these are like 40% off so, yeah, great deal. 4 stars!\n",
      "While I really can't prove it, I suspect that these are NOT genuine Apple earpods. They appear original initially, but it ends there. The microphone has serious quality issues. There is weird buzzing and popping when using the volume controls, and when used during a phone call, the other party complains that I sound \"muffled\". Interference renders these unusable while charging the phone, due to loud buzzing. They have a \"cheaper\" overall feel as well. I guess I could've just gotten a bad pair, but these in no way compare with the several \"genuine\" Apple buds that I've had in the past, which have all been of high quality. Save yourself the trouble, and just buy some from a retail store. This is the last \"genuine\" Apple product I'll be buying online. There is just too much knockoff junk out there to justify taking a chance.\n",
      "you can clear crystal in these headphones. I love them!\n",
      "goooooooood\n",
      "They work. They get loud enough.\n",
      "They felt fake they didn't work right and the pieces to the ear part was coming apart and the sound was horrible\n",
      "All perfect! Great sound!\n",
      "Great service they worked great!!\n",
      "These are falsely advertised as Apple. They are cheaply made, where the volume control feels more \"plasticky\" and the wires are thinner. The base of the wire, where you plug it in to your phone, pulled off the very first time I plugged them into my phone and tried to unplug it again. I bought two pair and they are the same, so it wasn't just an unlucky single item. They are made poorly.\n",
      "Good sound quality. Comfortable for the ears\n",
      "Great sound! Probably the only thing I like from Apple\n",
      "Excellent sound for the money.\n",
      "They work great and received it quickly.\n",
      "Great with iPhone 5. Able to hands free talk and listen to music effortlessly.\n",
      "Headphones worked great and are definitely worth the $30\n",
      "Love it! I ordered these headphones on August 18th and they came August 20th. That's really fast! Which is what I love and they work perfectly. The mic words and both earbuds work as well. The cord is just a bit too skinny but it doesn't matter to me. Thank you soo much and I will definitely order from this seller again.\n",
      "good\n",
      "Real deal!\n",
      "Nice \n",
      "I thought they are original earplugs like the one we get from Apple store. But they are nowhere close and there is some wierd sound coming from one of the earplug.. may be something loose inside. I would not suggest this product to anybody... in short, they are terrible..\n",
      "I got this for my dad and he loves it. He knows the difference between the ear phones and ear pods.\n",
      "Thank you very much for getting my Headphones here and early I really appreciated it I'll be shopping more around you my good sir. Thanks once again.\n",
      "Fantastic re-design. Great sound. Only earbuds I use\n",
      "Shipping was fast, and it was apple brand came in the apple case with the logo on the back. The bass sounds really good and the buttons work. I have yet to try the mic out but I will later today. Super happy with it\n",
      "I was surprised when I opened my package to see 2 sets or EarPods when I only ordered one! So that was cool. But the plastic tip of the EarPod that goes in your eat broke writhing the first 2 weeks. So I still have an extra but idk how long they'll last.\n",
      "The mic seems low\n",
      "These earpods are the best thing to use with Apple products. Well made, good sound quality and durable\n",
      "I like these way better than the in ear buds, especially for my phone. These are an extra set so I have a spare.\n",
      "Great!\n",
      "Tried purchasing an aftermarket alternative but realized the the OEM headset is superior. The volume control is probably one of favorite features.\n",
      "They broke at the piece that goes into the phone.\n",
      "Great product. Genuine Apple and great sound coming from apple products. (I only own apple so I can't speak for other devices). Would definitely recommend to anyone and everyone!\n",
      "Same as apple, 40 percent less or more if you consider tax and shipping.\n",
      "Last for a couple months. Then the volume changer goes, then one headphone stops working. I feel like the sound gets muffled over time. Unnecessary speaker on the outside of the headphone that just lets other people hear what youre listening too.\n",
      "They work just as normal Apple EarPods would\n",
      "Awesome earbuds no surprises.\n",
      "only headphones i will use\n",
      "These are Apple OEM new headphones.  They work as if you got them from the Apple Store.  No need to write anything more.  They are way better than regular ear buds & in ear buds.  These are the best.  & I'm no Apple fanboy.  No no no.  I'm neutral when it comes to Apple Versus Microsoft vs Sony vs etc.....  But Apple has a winner here.  Buy these.  You won't regret it.  It makes you wonder why anyone hasn't designed these before.  What were they thinking when manufacturers kept pushing out badly designed earbuds that don't even match the insides shapes of human ears!  I mean these things are a perfect fit for the outer ear canal.  Other buds just have to get forced in somehow & hurt after long periods of time.  Not THESE  They feel so natural.  EDIT:  I seemed to have washed them with a load of laundry.  They still work!  WTH?  Wow.  Are they water resistant or even proof?\n",
      "It is good product in earpod I ever purchased. The voice is so good and noise cancellation. Also the base is good.\n",
      "not in original packaging and the mic doesn't work\n",
      "excelent\n",
      "Original Apple Earpods. Doesn't come in original big package.\n",
      "Exactly what I wanted\n",
      "5 star\n",
      "Best Value Great Sound. These deliver great sound with great comfort.\n",
      "Great! Can put my phone in my pocket and have hands free conversations on my iPhone.  Especially handy when working in the kitchen fixing meals for my family. Like that there is a microphone.\n",
      "Still works perfectly after a couple months\n",
      "Genuine Apple product. Works just like the original that came with my iphone5.\n",
      "Excelent\n",
      "exactly what I expected them to be! And at a great price. Use them almost everyday, they're very comfortable too.\n",
      "I love the sound from these! The ones I received were definitely the Apple product. They are exactly the same as the ones my wife received with her iPhone.\n",
      "Sound great, just like the ones from Apple, just much cheaper.\n",
      "The same quality as the OEM, thanks.\n",
      "I just love these EarPods! They are great!\n",
      "The real mcCoy!  Very happy. Thank you!  I was very upset last week when I lost mine along with my curvyman last week on a flight to LA after a the grumpy flight attendant didn't let me properly stow away them away in my backpack above me before we left the gate.  So I am really happy I was able to replace them both for a reasonable price,\n",
      "Good product\n",
      "Plays my music. Defective. Has slight screeching sound while playing my music.\n",
      "Arrived on time. Sealed packet. Good quality. Good sound.\n",
      "Nice sound. Mic does not work with android phone.\n",
      "They are real...I love them and im very very satisfied with my order..\n",
      "Ok sound wise but very flimsy. I dropped them and the ear piece cover popped off. Once that happens they will never be the same and will continue to pop off. This has happened to me on two pairs\n",
      "I loved them and the service was fast!\n",
      "It stopped working after a week , DO NOT GET THIS ITEM , it's a waste of money\n",
      "I bought this, it was not working properly. They agreed on return but I had to pay for it (return cost).\n",
      "My ears are really small and these EarPods are uncomfortable to wear. The sound is alright, but the discomfort of the uncomfortably snug fit--outweighs the sound.\n",
      "I got this earpods a month ago and i have to say that they are awsome, i love them a lot, the sound and the quality are great, excellent for the price.\n",
      "Work great- good value\n",
      "awesome\n",
      "Excellent purchase\n",
      "I had this for less than 6 hours and it already stops working\n",
      "These head phones work great. Even when I am working out, whether its lifting or jogging, they stay snug in my ears without too much adjustment.\n",
      "they sound great, and fit very well  in my ears\n",
      "This is by far the best headphones i had, i mean woooww the crystal clear sound, the powerfull bass sound its incredible, i hightly recomend this headphones\n",
      "They don't fit in my ears, will buy the soft ear bud kind next time. Mechanically they are OK, maybe they deserve more stars for people with bigger ears!\n",
      "These are not the real thing!  So far the sound is fine but mine has a slight defect in the plastic earbud. These seem to be a knockoff Apple not the real thing. Time will tell how long they last.\n",
      "huge fan of these much cheaper than dre beats or something comparable\n",
      "Received knock-off headphones. Cheap feel, rattle in right earphone and terrible sound quality. Wrote to seller and was asked to return them on my dime. Would highly advise against buying.\n",
      "Showed up on time and was a great product\n",
      "Wow, impressed nice quality sound and the bass isn't to shabby it's a win.\n",
      "Fast delivery .. And  good buy ... Thanks.\n",
      "Authentic Apple EarPods at half the price. Didn't hear any difference in sound quality compared to the original earpods that came with iPhone.\n",
      "Arrived earlier than expected and work great! some said they wouldn't work w/ any other device  besides Apple, but I use them on motoactiv and it's fine. I can change songs, stop music, etc, all w/ the headset.\n",
      "Ear buds were perfect and so was the price\n",
      "This was represented as an Apple headset. It does look like an Apple ear pod..the mic didn't work and the sound quality is average at best. I am confident this is not a genuine apple product. You can do better for$5 at your local discounter. I don't recommend this product. I got a refund.\n",
      "good price!!!\n",
      "These are the real deal, and are an improvement over earlier generations (kind of like me). Good (not great, but good) sound quality, the buttons work consistently, and that's all you're looking for.\n",
      "After reading the reviews, i thought they would be the actual apple headphones\n",
      "Absolutely fantastic and works great\n",
      "Great\n",
      "Perfect sound, decent bass, fair price, I'd definitely reccomend it\n",
      "I am so happy, my product came early and in perfect condition and even came in the apple case to carry them in so they stay protected, they are working perfectly and have yet to falter. I am a on the go teen and they have stood the test of time.\n",
      "I ordered these replacement Apple EarPods for my son whose original Apple earbuds failed after a couple of years of use.  They are standard Apple: good quality, not exactly for audio files, but very useful.  Apple has improved its earphones with these EarPods from their original earbuds.\n",
      "LOVE THIS! :D So convenient!\n",
      "I was a little weary of purchasing these because of the reviews. I have now had these for half a month, and with almost daily use I can say these are great! The EarPods I got with my iPhone stopped working (it would skip/rewind songs, summon Siri, and hang up on calls) after a year and six months. I really enjoyed the Mic, and other functions of the EarPods so I wanted another pair. I use these when I commute to work, school, and even when workout (so they can withstand sweat).\n",
      "Bought these to replace a pair that I lost.  I like them better than the original pair.  Great quality & nice fit!\n",
      "Great replacement for my apple erapods\n",
      "These are indeed Apple OEM ear buds (earphones and microphone combination). Working well 2 weeks later.\n",
      "Excellent. Thank you\n",
      "I like that they actually stay in my ears (and fit perfectly). Unlike others or older apple's earpods, which are way too big for most of us with normal size ear canals.\n",
      "Was skeptical at first but these are legit! They're very loud and comfortable (for me). Perfect purchase. Thank you!\n",
      "Awesome sound quality at this rate.\n",
      "Great head phones. Perfect for both the gym and phone calls.\n",
      "Great headphones, I love them, but they didn't have as much bass as my other ones that came with my phone.\n",
      "Wasn't clear from the description that these are OEM/Refubished/Used - still not sure which.  To be clear, they work fine.\n",
      "Ordered 2 sets for my sons. Very disappointed as they broke within the first week of use and turned out not to be genuine Apple products. Amazon refunded my money very quickly though.\n",
      "I love this headphones\n",
      "Good product\n",
      "work great.\n",
      "It was great thanks.\n",
      "Works perfect! Highly recommend !!!\n",
      "Didn't even last a week\n",
      "It's a good thing Apple bout Beats! They are clearly outside of their area of expertise when it comes to making headphones.  I own a pair of $5 JVC headphones that sound / fit better then these headphones.  Stay away and don't be fooled by the brand.\n",
      "Great. Quick shipping\n",
      "excellent product\n",
      "Excellent EarPods  !!\n",
      "Amazing sound and there the real deal. Came in 3 day then it was supposed too.  And there half the price they which is a great value!!!\n",
      "These apple headphones are awesome. Great sound\n",
      "Nice\n",
      "The earpods work great, however they arrived with large chunks of ear wax in them (gross) so I had to spend a lot of time cleaning/disinfecting them. If I were going to do this over I'd just buy new ones from Apple.\n",
      "Used them for 2 weeks . Satisfied\n",
      "Good product\n",
      "Great earpods I have ever bought.\n",
      "I have had them for a few months now and they are awesome! No problems and better price than at the apple store.\n",
      "Liked the original, seems very difficult to get a guenine one. I ordered one of this from a seller with 96% positive, and still was fake.\n",
      "Wanted to replace the ones that came with my phone, and these did it. Shipping was pretty quick. Very happy with my purchase\n",
      "In love\n",
      "These are not real apple EarPods. Clearly knockoffs. Inferior, tinny sound. No bass. I have two other pairs of the real ones and these are not even close.\n",
      "I'm a runner and I love these. When it comes to earphones, I'm a one-issue voter. The only thing I care about is whether they fall off or not when I run. And these somehow manage to stay in my ears no matter what I do--running, midnight dancing, you name it. And the quality of sound is good enough for me. I'm not really picky in that category. So two thumbs up for other runners as well. Oh, and also, these look super cute. They go well with my baby-pink mp3 player. You'll be surprised how much a good design can make you feel better.\n",
      "Shipping was not 2 day as stated. Was sent by SmartPost instead of delivering to the house. took 4 days. They do not fit my ears and fallout frequently. The price went down $3.00 after I bought them. It was a reverse trifecta, 3 way loser.\n",
      "Quality below my expectations. I do not recommend this product.\n",
      "they knock-off but they do the job no bass though\n",
      "Not working good. Very bad quality. I definitely return back this item.\n",
      "I don't like .... That one not original apple headphone , microphone not work ... I cant' cantro volume....\n",
      "Volume controls didn't work, decided to return the item. Disappointed.\n",
      "Not like the real ones but good quality\n",
      "my daugther enjoy using this headset\n",
      "Excellent purchase!\n",
      "Its a lie, its not 'apple' ear-pods its a plain junky item its not worth the money even one dollar in the dollar store\n",
      "My grandson wanted these and checked out Best Buy to purchase them.  They were so much higher so he looked at Amazon and found them less expensive and good quality.  He is 13 and told me to get them at Amazon, a better deal.\n",
      "Perfect just like my original ones. High quality of both microphone and headphones. Definitely recommend this product\n",
      "Great sound. Great transaction.\n",
      "Love them! Work great!\n",
      "I used to have these headphones but my stupid college roommate stole them. Seeing they were basically half off I decided to get them again. They are great little headphones. Very comfortable, the sound is pretty great, and they come with the little music controller on the wire. I got them twice, so I obviously recommend these headphones for anybody.\n",
      "Great headphones\n",
      "Perfect\n",
      "Excellent product\n",
      "These headphones are good for the soul\n",
      "Right on time ,I like this ear pods with mic ,Great sound .\n",
      "Its an OK product. I had great expectations, but didnt find this product amazing. It's same as any other ear pods. So dont buy this item for this much amount.\n",
      "It sounds great I can hear and feel the base.\n",
      "Works like a charm. Mine came in a plastic bag type thing instead of those square cases they usually come in, but that's ok, because they work perfectly fine.\n",
      "Very good sounds\n",
      "these head phone are great when i listen to these compared to my cheap walmart ones these blow them away\n",
      "I don't think these are \"genuine Apple\" as they state.  They look like the ones I got with my iPhone 5, but the quality is ridiculously low. I ordered one pair, and received two pairs - Both of which didn't work right, right off the bat.  They even /feel/ like inferior products. Both have a problem where the sound and/or mic cuts out if you touch the cord, One of them has a loose or broken speaker in the earbud, that rattles when the sound gets moderately loud. A total waste of money.  Buy something from a real manufacturer instead.\n",
      "took a while to arrive but they came in the original apple package. Great product for a cheap price. Shipping was very slow though.\n",
      "These are $40 locally and with amazon I got 2 pairs for $18.\n",
      "Great!\n",
      "They work just fine\n",
      "good\n",
      "My daughter just opened them and they are already not working after 1 day.\n",
      "Thanks.\n",
      "As described.  Thank you\n",
      "Product as described; fast shipping!\n",
      "Excellent!\n",
      "The product was not good, it did not work. However I did get a refund for the faulty product so I am ok with it.\n",
      "Perfect!  These have the exact same great sound quality as the original Apple earbuds that came with my iPhone.  Great product!\n",
      "The product was exactly as represented, they were delivered quickly and work great.\n",
      "I bought these after my subjected my previous ones to significant water damage. They are exactly like the original headphones that came with my iPhone 5. So far, the little guys have done their job well. Moreover, they are significantly cheaper than what you can find at your local department store.\n",
      "Good solid headphones, the mic and volume controls are almost perfect. Works extremely well with iPhones when placing calls or FaceTimeing. Solid headphones for $18. You'll pay $30 at the apple store for them.\n",
      "love it\n",
      "These ear Pods work really good and don't make my ears like so many other ear phones do. I wish I could use the volume control. Because I use them with my s4.\n",
      "Love to use these and they came in quick .\n",
      "Oh my god I loved this headphones but sadly I lost it but I might buy a new one!\n",
      "It works very well. Will be buying another soon I'm sure after I lose this one. :P\n",
      "LEGIT\n",
      "these are not real I phone 5 headphones. the headphones suck and the bass is horrible. the quality is bad and there was no tracking on the shipment so I wasn't able to se where it was at.\n",
      "Perfect. Same as the exact same thing at the Apple Store but half  the price.  What's not to like?\n",
      "So far, so good!  I've bought others through groupon, and they broke almost immediately, or the mic didn't function. These seem pretty good, although there does seem to be a slight crunchiness in the mic.  And the price is unbeatable!!  My 7th graders need mic-in ear buds for school, I'll probably buy them here if I can.\n",
      "Yesssss!!!!!!! I hate the fact that these cost $30 to buy in the store so I found this seller and bought 2 pair since they are half the price. As far as I know they are the official Apple EarPods. They look, smell and feel like the real deal. Either way the buy was a steal lol. Thanks again! Don't be surprised if I place an order for about 30 more!!!!\n",
      "These are not, actually, Apple EarPods.  For some people, I suppose that much is clear, but for people like me, take it from someone who now knows.  Nobody knows who actually made these, but they aren't genuine.  Want the best proof I can give you?  Go to Apple's online store and look at the cost of these.  Spoiler alert, it's about ten bucks more than these.  You can also see it in the hardware of the Earbuds; there are basic cosmetic errors that Apple generally avoids.  Then there is the sound.  These frequently static loudly and the quality is generally just unimpressive.  Avoid buying these if you can, save the ten bucks, and buy the actual Apple ones from Apple's actual store, you can no longer buy them at Amazon, unfortunately.  Please, take my advice.  If you don't mind crap quality, buy this.  If you want the genuine product, steer clear.\n",
      "on time delivery and headphones just as described\n",
      "I haven't bought apple earphones in like 2 years because I've always had an android. The earphones that came with my android weren't good so I thought I might try these. I am currently listening to music on these earphones and I can tell you they sound great! The price is awesome! I think if I go to a store and look for apple headphones they will be at least 30 bucks. I would definitely recommend these. Great Buy!\n",
      "great price for oem product\n",
      "Love these earbuds. When I first got them with my iPhone, I loved them! I was so sad when my dog got a hold on them and chewed one of the earbuds, ruining it. I had to look for a new pair and bought these. They work perfectly! And actually, the ones I had from apple didn't have the remote and mic, so that's a great bonus.\n",
      "I totally recommend these headphones! The sound is great and they're not expensive I received them way before the estimated delivery date! Totally satisfied!!\n",
      "Great sound. Connected with no problem through the opening in the protective case.\n",
      "wonderfull\n",
      "A MUST HAVE\n",
      "Good as expected\n",
      "I tested this out by calling a few friends and asking them, \"Hey I'm using a new microphone piece... can you hear me okay? Do I sound far away or muffled? Is there static?\" And they all said that I sounded crystal clear. I've used it for many hours now and I'm really happy with it, especially for the price. My only gripe is that the ear buds don't stay in my ears as well as I would have liked, but I know other people who use these same ones without that problem, so I guess it just depends on your ear.\n",
      "My daughter is very happy with them.\n",
      "BEST earpods i've purchased!!!\n",
      "EarPods arrived earlier than expected-always a plus. The EarPods stay in your ears and they don't fall out. Sound quality gets a B+. Like the availability of the microphone.\n",
      "As described - thanks for the simple buying experience.\n",
      "I had the earphones for about two hours & the right one only worked if the jack was in a certain place\n",
      "original apple earpods as advertised!\n",
      "These EarPods did not work properly.  A slight move of the cables disrupts the sound and causes silence in one earbud.  I might have received a defective one.  Oh well, maybe I will stick to the real ones at the Apple Store and forgo the \"savings\".\n",
      "Great product with a great price\n",
      "The bass is amazing and these earphones fit perfectly in your ears, they don't slip out, I've decided that I'm going to purchase another pair of these soon.\n",
      "Received the item earlier then projected. They work perfectly.\n",
      "I've always had Bose earphones, but when they needed to be replaced, I decided to try these.  I didn't expect much; after all, the price is quite a bit less than the Bose sets are.  Having said that, the price is what made me decide to give them a try.  I am so glad I did!  They are perfect!  The sound is top notch - they are comfortable - they fit well.  A terrific set for a terrific price!\n",
      "right headphone was messed up :/\n",
      "The shape fits perfect to ears.  The sound doesn't directly hit the ear.  The sound quality is good enough.\n",
      "I love them , super cool. On time\n",
      "I bought my Iphone 5c back in November (2013) and considering the fact that i have used the headphones i got included with my phone almost every single day, about 2 days ago the right ear blew and now only the left ear works. The bass is outstanding and that is my favorite part of the headphones. Now im about to purchase these ones, hopefully they work out just as well! I hate wasting money!\n",
      "DO NOT BUY. I REPEAT. DO NOT BUY THIS. Volume control does not work. If you twist it even a little bit, the volume changes... Buy this if you plan on not moving when you listen to your music.\n",

      "quick and good\n",

      "very good phones, does seem to make it more quiet, quick ship, good product and ve\n",
      "These are really good for what they are and for how much they cost.I own a lot of headphones,including some high end Denon earbuds,Shure ,AKG etc. and although these Apple earpods are not in their league,I end up using these the most ,because of their size,comfort,great sound and durability.Make sure you are buying genuine product though-there is a lot of fakes,so buy only from an authorized dealer .\n",
      "Excellent service and product quality.\n",

      "Exactly what I wanted!\n",
      "I love these EarPods.  They play loud and clear. I don't leave home without them.\n",
      "I bought the earphones a couple of days ago, they are comfortable and fit for my ears.\n",
      "Authentic an work great!\n",
      "They are really bad sound quality and DO NOT work with pc's or any other audio jacks besides apple products. Really bad investment and buying new headphones only a couple of days after purchasing. Also, it DIDNT work on an onion like the commercial said it would. Nice job, Bill!\n",
      "Were not working after a week, not happy at all\n",
      "These weren't the same item advertised. I received the regular round type earphones and it wasn't in original packaging. Previously I ordered two from seller \"hotfuleco\" those were in original packaging and correct items\n",
      "when i recieved this, the earpods ' box clearly has been used, but i didn't want to a hassle to return it for that, so i tried it, and the earpods sound so not right, and very sharp on my ear, so i thought it might be something wrong with my phone. then just about 3 weeks, the earpods' Mic turn to slience, and no one could hear me anymore, then i relize that it got broken with no reason. and i was so mad, i had to go to apple store to exchange, and they almost refused change for me. Cz they said that some people just fix a old one then sell as a new one, but the guy was so nice and changed for me. then i tried with the exchange one that i relized my phone is fine, and just Cz the earpods wasn't good. i won't buy from this seller anymore.\n",
      "I haven't tried the mic out but so far I love these earphones! I can hear everything really clear, and they fit nice in my ears. They just go right in almost as if it was too small but they have never fallen out and they don't dig into my ears either. The bass is a little hard to describe, I do kind of like the earphones that have a great amount of bass to them so with this design I didn't expect must bass. Its like a new kind of feeling with these earphones because I can't feel the bass but I can hear its kind of weird but in a good way. Its also impossible to mix up which earphone goes into which ear too because each earphone is designed for one ear only so thats cool haha. I'm not a too big of a fan when it comes to Apple but they really did something right here and I would recommend these to anyone\n",
      "Don;t work properly\n",
      "Fit comfortably, sound fine, work great. Much better than the old Apple headphones.\n",
      "No complains\n",
      "There was a cut on the cord, but item was rated in excellent condition. The pants were not the size large i normally wear.\n",
      "perfect\n",
      "It worked great for almost a month, then all of a sudden the left bud stopped working.  I wasn't rough with it, I didn't use it all the time.  I tried to get a refund, they said my return time had expired.\n",
      "They are Apple Earbuds, enough said!\n",
      "This is the fourth time I have ordered apple earpods after my first pair (that came with my phone) broke. I bought a different (slightly cheaper) pair, and three different pairs were either damaged or broke within 2 days of use.\n",
      "Awesome EarPods!!!!!!!  Quick service too!\n",
      "I just got these earpods today but they look 100% real! But they have an inscription saying \"designed by Apple in California made in China and people have been telling me they are knock offs please help!\n",
      "They broke after 8 days, but they still good headphones\n",
      "Once in a while, I experience the static noise with this head phone set. Not sure why???\n",
      "Surprise\n",
      "I mainly bought these headphones for working out and running. The sound quality surprised me as it was extremely clear! I have yet to use the mic feature because i find little use for it, but i would still recommend these to anyone!\n",
      "They were broken on day one.  Sound doesn't work properly.  Returning and going to the Apple store to buy headphones.\n",
      "Just what I expected\n",
      "Work great - great price\n",
      "Awesome replacement headphones! Apple brand (as far as I can tell) and sound great!\n",
      "Everything about these are great.  If you need new EarPods I highly recommend these.  Great Price and Superb Quality.\n",
      "It appears that these are actual Apple product headphones. So far so good.\n",
      "Not real bad quality didn't sound good at all\n",
      "Genuine apple EarPods. Excellent.\n",
      "No complaints. Sound great\n",
      "Everything was perfect! And they came in pretty fast! Loved itt.\n",
      "I loved the sound that came out of them, wore them all the time, but then, the left EarPods speaker went out, so i was bumped for a while, then went ahead and got another pair, 1 month later the left EarPod went out. so far with my experiences, the left EarPod speaker that is farthest into the ear stops working and the rest keep on working, i don't think I'll get another pair because they haven't seemed to last as long, my PSN earbuds made for the PS Vita lasted longer and only broke when i slept on them and accidentally pulled it apart trying to get it not knowing it was under me...on the EarPods though, he right EarPod hasn't stopped working, most likely due to it having the controls on that EarPod. Though it does have great sound, it spontaneously stops working one day without me even touching them for a while...\n",
      "Great item.\n",
      "One side broke after a couple of days.\n",
      "Replaced the earphones for the Iphone 4G and they work excellently\n",
      "like\n",
      "These sound very good but won't stay in my ears.  If I hold them in place the sound is excellent but I really don't want to walk around with my hands covering my ears.  The buds are smooth plastic and I believe that's the problem.  Rubber buds will stay in my ears with no problem.\n",
      "These were counterfeit. I will not do business again\n",
      "Gets the job done. I like these pods because they stay in my ear and they are very clear.\n",
      "Using them now!  Excellent!\n",
      "Terrible quality.\n",
      "Great find/price !!\n",
      "It was garbage\n",
      "I was very very happy with sirvice\n",
      "These sound much better than more expensive ones do\n",
      "Bad bad bad... My head earphones came in the mail and I opened it and tried to use it but it didn't work, the earphones were already used and damaged with torn wire and looks like they tried to superglue it together ...I'm so disappointed with this seller.\n",
      "These are NOT Apple EarPods. These are cheap imitations.  You can tell the chintzy materials used as soon as you touch the packaging. I've had them for two days, and the sound is not good like real Apple headphones, and they already have a short, and are starting to fall apart.  And I'm not hard on my headphones.  I wear them around the house listening to audiobooks while I clean.  Total waste of $20!\n",
      "Came fast and great quality. Thank you!\n",
      "Arrived onetime. Apple product with same quality as the one I purchased in the Apple store. I have other ear pods but they don't deliver the same sound. Much happier with Apple ear pods.\n",
      "My husband loves these and they are apple quality!\n",
      "Very comfortable and being able to remotely adjust the volume was just what I was looking for. Came in the original Apple container so you know it's the real thing.\n",
      "Expected nothing less than a great product. Great sound and clear voice on calls.\n",
      "The right side started shocking inside my ear. The mic stopped working. I don't think they were an official APPLE product.\n",
      "Ok item\n",
      "Very good earbuds. I like the sound quality, don't get me wrong they aren't beats or AT but for cheap headphones they are nice. Way to go Apple!\n",
      "i dont like them. they are fake. not apple\n",
      "Came well packaged and original just in case.\n",
      "Sounds great\n",
      "Bad quality. Mic makes your voice sound muffled. Not authentic apple earpods don't buy unless you like overpriced counterfeit earphones.\n",
      "These don't really work. As soon as they were shipped I tried them and the audio cut in and out unless you hold the cord just right. Do not purchase.\n",
      "I got these on 2-day shipping.  And I'm very upset thaf I spent so much money on something that doesn't even WORK. I am sooo disappointed with this seller. VERY BAD.\n",
      "Just want I needed\n",
      "This is the second time I bought these.  They work great.  I will probably get one more.  I keep giving them away.\n",
      "Thanks\n",
      "Exactly what I wanted, plus fast shipping!\n",
      "Great ear pods.\n",
      "Perfect! Very fasting shipping!! These earpods are way better than the ones samsung bundles in with their Galaxy S5\n",
      "It was not bad, but I dont know y the background music will louder than the singer sound.\n",
      "it was perfect just the way i wanted it\n",
      "The EarPods are perfect but the plastic box is a little bit dirty and has some defects\n",
      "Excellent\n",
      "I can hear so much better on my iPad.\n",
      "good product. If only they lasted longer than 6 months.\n",
      "There was a misunderstanding with the description of the product. Everything was solved fast and profesionally. Highly recommended!!!! Very happy with the product!!!!\n",
      "its fake, don't buy it, if the price is low\n",
      "Arrived quickly, sound quality is good and it's easy to adjust volume.\n",
      "Good\n",
      "The left ear pod doesn't work as well as the right, so the majority of the sound is very right-side heavy. Other than that, the pods themselves are very comfortable to wear for a long period of time!!\n",
      "I love it\n",
      "great product\n",
      "Just as advertised, Apple iphone earpods. Great sound and quality! Will do business again.\n",
      "The buds come in a case with the Apple logo. It looks like the real thing. However, after two days of light usage, the plastic joint that joins the audio input to the cord disintegrated, exposing the inner wiring. Needless to say, they were beyond useless.\n",
      "Worked well, no complaints so far.\n",
      "good product\n",
      "They should have cleaned out the ear wax before they sent them to me. These are customer returns not NEW !\n",
      "Fast shipping good product.\n",
      "Ummm... I'm confused. I received two copies but only ordered one. But both copies feel like they have been made by a side shop near china town.  Still great sound quality but not the real deal if ur gonna buy the real ones.\n",
      "What I expected and on time.\n",
      "The item provided appears to be the genuine article, but this in my fourth pair - the sound on one ear keeps going out after a few months.  This style of earpods are hard and have no give so they are a bit hard on my ears, but I keep buying them anyway for the great sound quality.\n",
      "ok\n",
      "These are not manufactured by Apple.  These are cheap cheap cheap knockoffs that shouldn't be selling for more than $5.  The plastic is shoddy, the seems and edges are rough, things rattle around on the inside, and one of the buttons on the mic has already jammed up.\n",
      "Not worth buying just buy ones in the apple store\n",
      "These are the best earphones out there! Great bass and overall great sound quality. Great for listening to dubstep and even Pink Floyd . Buy these ! You won't regret it .\n",
      "It's ok but not as good as the Apple store products.\n",
      "they were not authentic apple earpods. hey work well but not the quality i expected\n",
      "I am pleased with my product.  thank you.\n",
      "Bought my headphones from the company brown box bonanza great contdition original they sound great i had one but they broke and now im back w these\n",
      "needed them and got them... perfect!\n",
      "Good.\n",
      "works great\n",
      "Best!!!\n",
      "These are counterfeit earbuds. Not an apple product. I will be returning mine and contacting the company in the morning!\n",
      "Great.\n",
      "fit and work as expected\n",
      "I ordered them and yes, for the first week they were great.  But im not sure if it was just me if after about a week, week and a half that they significantly got lower and then altogether stopped working in one ear.  I shouldnt have to replace \"good headphones\" every 2 months.\n",
      "Apple ear phones are the best... so when someone pilfered mine (I'm being nice) I was devastated until my new ones arrived. :)\n",
      "Absolutely perfect. In stores there usually cost $29.99 but here your basically get it half off. and unlike the stores that give it to you in the clear squarish plastic box. This they actually gave it in an official ( iphone like box) packaging. i was like wow. just superb. sound quality is the best no defect or anything.\n",
      "Sound good\n",
      "best earbud on market\n",
      "Earphones worked as they should do and are well priced.\n",
      "grandchildren said these were the best ever and most comfortable.\n",
      "Not real Apple headphones. Felt light and cheap. Broke in less than 2 weeks. Microphone piece completely fell apart. Asking for my money back!!\n",
      "Clear sounds and great fit in the ear.\n",
      "The headphones came in an apple case. It worked fine but one of the ear pieces stopped working after 3days. I should of known this was going to happen bc the last pair I bought the entire ear piece fell apart. It is made of cheap plastic and will break within the first two weeks of having it. I will be buying the official apple headphones next time.\n",
      "bottom of the line, terrible sound, barely audible\n",
      "Ok\n",
      "Perfect\n",
      "Less than 10 days of light use, the cord is ripped.  I wounder if it could be fixed or replaced.\n",
      "Genuine apple product\n",
      "Genuine Apple product.  FAB\n",
      "It is a real good product\n",
      "Grate stuff all OEM\n",
      "The real deal.\n",
      "My kitten destroyed the earbuds that originally came with my iPhone 5C so I got these as a replacement.  They work perfectly and are identical to the ones that came with my phone.  I highly recommend that you get a pair as a replacement or a backup!\n",
      "The pair that I received were not genuine Apple ear buds. they seemed right at first but when I compared then to the set my father got with his iPhone 5 its obvious they were fake. Plus the ear bud fell apart on my third time putting them in.\n",
      "The only positivity is the delivery time. Out of the box, the microphone was loose. The left bud was never functional. You'd be better served elsewhere.\n",
      "I have loved these ever sense they came out and have had very successful pairs.. but within weeks my Mic broke and have to twist and wiggle the Jack piece to get my tablet to read that they are in the in use.\n",
      "Arrived as promised and exactly as expected!\n",
      "Perfect doesn't look fake (or feel) I'm more happy with them.\n",
      "Came with someone else's ear gunk! Had to clean myself. Was sent replacements that also came dirty. When I contacted them they were very professional in handling my issue and tried to make things right that's why I gave them two stars. Was not looking for a refund but glad they gave me my money back\n",
      "the sound is really good\n",
      "These are the authentic apple earpods that come with the new iphones (5 and 5s) with the mic and remote. Just make sure it says that in the title. Don't choose the different colors if you want the originals. (Apple doesn't make earpods in any other color than white). Decent quality at the compromise for portability. Love them, I had to replace my old apple earbuds that I lost. And these sound way better.\n",
      "To bit to arrive but worth the wait!\n",
      "Good as the ones that came with my iPhone!\n",
      "They are nice head phones but there is no remote false advertizimg\n",
      "Working great\n",
      "I love these headphones. The work, sound great, and are a revolutionary design. Honestly, I am so glad apple put the extensive research into making these great phones at an affordable price. One thing of special mention is the bass response.\n",
      "DISGUSTING.  USED and had earwax on the ear buds when they were delivered\n",
      "Good\n",
      "great\n",
      "These earpods seems to be copy of real apple earpods. These don't have that quality and finishing that apple has.\n",
      "Do not buy! Waste of money!  They are fake!  Base is not good when listening to music!\n",
      "The whole thing is shorter than my old one which difficult.\n",
      "Brand new and defiantly true apple ear buds! These are for sure the real deal and not some knock off brand (: well worth the cost!!!! Very happy customer here\n",
      "I think these are more hyped over than how good they actually are, I mean they are pretty good but eventually get uncomfortable.\n",
      "It is better than average headphones with this price.\n",
      "Very good\n",
      "Excellent\n",
      "For being in ear headphones and for this price, these are awesome!\n",
      "Bad buy\n",
      "Great product\n",
      "Amazing\n",
      "good sound and they say in my ears when moving.\n",
      "This was a gift for my 14 year old granddaughter, she \"loves' it's sound quality and comfortable fit. The color matches her IPOD, too!\n",
      "They came fast with no confusion and i love the earpods\n",
      "Just like my old ones that I accidentally ran over with my car.\n",
      "I love it\n",
      "They only lasted 2 weeks, the stem came apart. Would not recommend. They were. Gift for my grandson, and sent to him. So I could not send them back, did not save the original packaging. Would not re- order, what a waste of money.\n",
      "They work perfectly with my iPhone 5s and came in described condition, like new! :)\n",
      "Headphones are fake. Do not buy. They sound terrible and are not the same quality.\n",
      "These are NOT real Apple EarPods.  As soon as you take them out of the package you can feel the lesser build quality.  I compared these to a pair that were included with my iphone and quality of materials is not even close. Please keep that in mind when considering purchasing these head phones.\n",
      "Just got them. Opened them. Using them now. They are the same as the ones that got stolen from me. These are legit iphone5 headphones. Love em\n",
      "it takes only few days for the shipment thats a plus. however, the remote didnt work after a week from the day i received it\n",
      "Perfect!\n",
      "These are the real deal. I got mine today and compared them to my own pair of EarPods from Apple, these were the same exact ones.\n",
      "I wish they came in different colors since everyone in my family takes each other's headphones.  I think the earbud is too big also but they seam to be the best of what's out there.  Disappointed in apple.....\n",
      "It's just like the factory ones, if i remember correctly. Good volume. Sensitive microphone. Everything works great. I recommend it\n",
      "Awesome delivery, great product\n",
      "Excellent headphones and excellent delivery time!! Make sure you CLEAN THEM WITH ALCOHOL before you use them because mine were alittle dirty that's the only reason why it isn't 5 stars\n",
      "Great item\n",
      "Brand New Apple Earbuds. Perfect!\n",
      "Good product exactly as described.\n",
      "Works great. Bought two pair, one for my wife and one for me.\n",
      "These stay in much better than the old style ones.  They are still fairly fragile though and tend to break easily.\n",
      "Exactly what we wanted.\n",
      "Came in fast and work very well. Happy customer.\n",
      "Awesome price for an awesome product.Shipped quicker than expected!\n",
      "These are NOT REAL APPLE EarPods.  I've had a pair of real earphones before, and these sound horrible, the buttons don't work, and the microphone is horrible when using to talk on the phone.  CAVEAT EMPTOR!  They're NOT worth the $20 I paid for them.\n",
      "all good, new equipment on hand, excellent packaging, delivery in record time\n",
      "Perfect fit!\n",
      "I paid for and was supposed to get a new one but what was delivered was a used one... It didn't come in apple 's box, the plastic wrap on the case was so scratched up... It works good but, I'm not sure who's ears it was on before mine had to sanitize it.\n",
      "This product is a knock off. Poor build quality. They sound OK but the headphone cables are very low gauge which means that the may work now but won't for much longer. Also, the seller won't return them when you realize you purchased a fraudulent and sub par product.\n",
      "EXCELENTE PRODUCTO\n",
      "nice\n",
      "Didn't like how low they sound. Questioning authenticity\n",
      "IPhone won't recognize the product. Total waste of money\n",
      "Well, these earphones are great. I like how I can play and pause my music with the touch of a button on the cord instead of unlocking my phone to do it. Also, I like how I can control the volume the same way. The remote on the wire looks like a crushed straw. The middle button is used to play and pause music along with answering and hanging up phone calls. On either end of the remote on the wire our volume controls. You press the one on top to turn the volume up and the one on the bottom to turn the volume down. If you hold down the middle button, it will control Siri. I would highly recommend these earphones. The only downside is if you are putting them in a Windows computer, the microphone or the control on the cord will not work. The microphone is also on the wire it is on the other side of the buttons and it is smooth, so it is not something you can feel. These are Apple headphones, so they will not work with Windows computers.\n",
      "There great!\n",
      "Quality\n",
      "Great buds. Exactly what I was looking for\n",
      "Completely original item. Apple certified. I love the apple EarPods, they sound pretty good for the price and they work perfectly with my iphone 5s. I bought these for half price and free shipping so it is an awesome deal.\n",
      "Junk Product - I thought it to be of Apple's or Is as good as Apple's Product, but they shipped some junk product in white color, even sound control is not present.Worst experience ever\n",
      "Great earpods at a good price.\n",
      "Very good sound and fits great in my ears. Love it!\n",
      "Not genuine Apple headphones & they did not even work properly.\n",
      "Apple is the best\n",
      "Don't buy the cheap ones! These work if you get the originals.\n",
      "Great earphones seems like the real deal.  Haven't had it fall apart on me. (-1 star because the volume rockers only work for apple products)\n",
      "Good product, great price! Genuine Apple EarPods, with the nice little carrying case.\n",
      "All good.\n",
      "you said this one is original one but it is not. my friend is very disappointed in me... don't buy this item\n",
      "The design, sound quality, and features are all excellent! These earbuds have great bass for the price. Overall the sound quality is extremely awesome. The EarPods wouldn't fall off your ear. Great earbuds for the price!\n",

      "Amazing\n",
      "I'm not sure if these are actual Apple EarPods. They shipped to me in a small zip lock bag inside a yellow envelope. They appear to be visually identical to my old EarPods, but the sound and microphone quality seem to be sub-standard. I'm skeptical to say the least.\n",
      "My wife has original apple ear buds... the wire is made of rubber and this one is made of plastic ... Doesnt look like original ... but sounds good though ...\n",

      "This product was advertised as original Apple product.  It Is not an Apple Product!  This is a fraud.\n",
      "For the cost I guess I should have expected what I received. The apple case they arrived in was clearly used and let's just say I could tell the earbuds had been \"worn\" before. Gross.\n",
      "Very pleased with these Apple EarPods.  The sound-quality is impressive and they are very comfortable.\n",
      "not genuine Apple earphone. Though rough quality, it looks quite close to the Apple earphone I bought from Best Buy. The sound quality is horrible. Not recommended.\n",
      "The volume is a bit low.\n",

      "great earphones. work great\n",
      "Fake earphones (bought from WhiteRock). I used originals for more than 1.5years and I can tell by the look and feel these are complete fake. The wire is thinner and volume control is much stiffer and they were used to top that!! They were dirty when I opened the box. Also din have any manual etc... the box had a fake tape holding it together...\n",
      "These are way more comfortable than the iPhone 4 version.  The ear buds are tapered so they don't hurt after a few hours - I can wear them all day at work and they never hurt.  The speaker button and mike is the same as the 4, but they worked fine.  I've used it for several phone calls and there was no problem with the person hearing me/me hearing them.\n",
      "Excellent headphones because of sound quality--more specifically the bass (that I was never able to fully hear) and the fact that it eliminates so much more outside noise than the previous headphones.\n",
      "Nothing new but I just prefer apple headphones over other ones due to the reason I feel them more comfortable.\n",
      "Really good item. Total worth the money.\n",
      "I am very satisfied Thank you!!!\n",
      "Really awesome pair of 20$ headphones. Who cares if they are bass heavy, it's much better than the previous iPhone earbuds. They have not broke yet cause I actually bought them at a STORE not online. Go to beat buy and buy them cause they are actually REAL. Really worth the money\n",
      "Volume is limited and the ear buds break apart when you drop them\n",

      "Im kinda confused by the amazon site. So I wasnt buying it from Apple through this website?\n",

      "Excellente\n",
      "Fast shipping, just as described\n",
      "These are great little ear phones for price. They are genuine Apple Ear Pods. The mic picks up very well; meaning you don't have to talk loud to be heard. You can also control the volume and pause play functions on iPhones/iPods. I sleep with mine in and they tend to stay in. Some people may have problems with that based on their anatomy or if they are a restless sleeper. I shouldn't review the fidelity of them since me ears were damaged by noise in the military. But that being said for me they sound great; and no I don't have to play them really loud. They give good results even at low volumes. Something important about these is that Apple seems to have fixed the insulation; the old ear buds used to stiffen up; which is probably a reaction to skin oils. I've used this model for over a year and haven't seen any of that old problem. I'm hard on mine so I bought two this time; and when I finally break these I'm buy them again. Great Product!\n",

      "This is not an original Apple headphones. Flimsy, thin, plastic is sticking out at mold seams, as you would see on very cheap plastic products. They were not even trying to make it look genuine. Sound is OK, but volume is much lower then original Apple headphones.\n",
      "Clear, clean sound. The mike and volume control work well. Doesn't mute external noise much, but I knew that going in. You'd have to spend substantially more to get a better ear bud.\n",

      "Actual apple product. You are never sure. Got at a great price to replace a pair that my sister's dog ate.\n",
      "Great price! Quick delivery! Ordering a second pair.\n",
      "Great! They are exactly as described. I like the new Pod style - the sound is much better. It isn't as good as a 30 dollar headphone of course but its good for commuting.\n",

      "Some of the posts on here are claiming that these are fake or knock off Apple EarPods.. I assure you they are not.  I just got mine and compared these to my existing set of EarPods which I got with my iPhone 5 and they're identical.. sound quality and all.  Good stuff!\n",
      "i love these i have owned bose i.e.2  great but flimsy cable  iPhone 770g/a  apple 850g/A and the B i loved those but  i could not hear my surroundings. these headphone blow them all away.  they don't get five stars because the pastil casing scraps my ear canal\n",
      "My 2nd time buying, since I lost the others. These are my favorite! The sound is clear and good, packaged well and arrived at the expected time.\n",
      "The quality of this product was suburb and the sound is amazing. I recommend this product to everyone. It even comes with a little case.\n",
      "Everything was greater than I expected. The product arrived in a great condition with the case as shown in the picture and it worked.\n",
      "i have this for about 2months until now. it's sound is the best. strong bass, nice sound. i love it.\n",
      "Naturally, when one buys a new product, one expect new in every sense software the word. First use had shortages, as sound keeps cutting in and out., so I'm not sure if I got a new \"apple\" product. Then I check the case and it had so many scratches, that I have serious doubt. Haven't used it since...\n",
      "I've had this kind of earphones before and the quality aren't the same if compare them: the sound wasn't good, even the weight, the feeling wasn't the same! I bought two and one of them never worked. I'm from Venezuela so I can't return it\n",
      "These work okay but these don't seem to be original manufacturer. They turn on the radio sometimes at random. The apple manufacturer don't turn in radio at random\n",
      "The headphones are apple headphones and not some knockoffs that are being sold from some websites. I do recommend them\n",
      "I have ordered two pairs of the earpods. The packaging of the both was weared off - the plastic has a lot of scratches. The one box had no plastic wrapping around it, the second was dirty. On of the earpods pair was not packed if the right way - the remote was wrapped around the box, and was not it its place.\n",
      "This was a replacement. I've been using these EarPods for a while. I love the earPods with remote and Mic. It fulfill my needs very well.\n",
      "I'm not an apple person, but these are a gargantuan improvement over the last model. My friend had one of these and I tried it and loved them so I bought myself a pair.\n",
      "Was skeptical about the brand, but yes they are original apple earphones. The box was little dirty, but earphones itself are clean and new.\n",
      "When I received this product I quickly noticed something was not right about the packaging and the units themselves. After looking a little closer I noticed this is not the \"official\" Apple EarPods like they are advertised. The sound Quality was fine until one of the ears stopped working recently. I would avoid this \"fake\" product and buy the real thing from Apple\n",
      "As far as I can tell, they are the real deal, package and all are apple, and work real well.\n",
      "I NEVER review anything I buy on Amazon. Ever. I have purchased hundreds of products and am generally happy with them. In this case, I want to make sure NOONE wastes their money in the same way I did with these things.\n",
      "My original ear pods went through the wash so insulation got kinked. Wanted a second pair anyway. Can't go wrong with Apple original\n",
      "I received them this week and they are great, worth buying the apple brand, they fit perfectly in your ears and the sound is great.  That you can control the sound level is also a plus.\n",
      "I got this product as a gift for my father for fathers day and he loves it cause they're slim and when he is playing music he can pause it without having to take out his ipod to change or pause the song\n",
      "Very unacceptable!  They were not iphone! They were some type of knock-off. The cord was only 3 ft in length.\n",
      "Exactly what I expected, high quality just like the ones that came with my phone that were stolen. I like the way the buds fit in my ear, and I use these while jogging.\n",
      "I liked it because of its sound quality and brand new looks...also this is a nice product for music lovers...thanks!\n",
      "remote onlyworks occasionally. besides the remote the ear pieces fit great and you can't even tell they're in. I use them 24/7 and have no problems (other than the remote).\n",
      "Now it is the regular headphones without remote - disappointing! And it really has problems with mini-jack - I clued it several times - the insulation always tends to go out of connector's body. It is definitely not Apple product - Chinese replica, may be. Do not waste your 15 backs.\n",
      "These are the best earpods for my iphone.  Don't know why I should rate this product when you won't let me rate my wife's books.\n",
      "The EarPods are much more comfortable than previous apple earbuds. The sound is quite good. These are great for general, casual use, nothing too complicated but have all the necessary features.\n",
      "The headphones were working at first, and then the jack randomly started to pop out of my phone and now won't stay connected, causing the audio to stop. It'll work it I hold it at the right angle, but it's not very convenient when I'm using my hands for something else. I'm very disappointed, don't buy from this seller. /:\n",
      "So far, so good.  The sound quality is great.  My last Apple earpods only lasted for about a year before one side went out.  I hope I get a longer life with these.  Would have been 5 stars, but the price is too high for headphones.\n",
      "They were just as I expected. I will say this:  The Apple Ear-Pods are the best sounding in their price range that I have heard.\n",
      "Not delivered by Apple, but they're the same exact headphones and $10 cheaper than you can get them at Best Buy. That's a good deal if you ask me. I know these are quality because I've had them before and am now purchasing them again, no other headphones produce such quality sound for such a great price. Plus, the case they come in is perfect for storing them in your pocket or backpack with no tangled mess whatsoever and increased longevity from lack of abrasions.\n",
      "Exactly as described - great quality - perfect for the job and really easy to use\n",
      "I like these very much! They fit nicely in my ears, sound great and they weren't too expensive. They even arrived well before the projected delivery date. I'm happy with my purchase.\n",
      "Work just as well as the original ones I got with my iphone. I like these much better than the Sony or Phillips headphone I bought. They seem to have much better sounds. They probably aren't as nice a 70 dollar headphone but they work well and you can use them as a mic too which is nice when you're on the phone.\n",
      "I hated Apple's previous generation of ear buds. Their sound quality was abysmal. But this new approach, while it somewhat resembles the old design, is a complete transformation. Though they rest in the outer parts of your ears and do not enter the ear canal, their tiny bass port magically conveys all the deep parts of music that the old ear buds were unable to. The result: all-day comfort, ability to hear what's going on around you, and music reproduction quality that rivals competitors costing two or three times as much.\n",
      "Seller did what they said they would. I'm just not a fan of the apple buds. I Hate them with a passion. I don't know what made me purchase them.\n",
      "Better headphones out there that are more crispier. It does the job, however the sound is not the greatest with them\n",
      "These earbuds work great while running, I haven't had them fall out once, and you can change volume and pause music from them, which is all I really need. I got these for way less than all the other apple earbuds that were listed which worried me a little, but as far as I can tell they are at least as good as the ones that originally came with my iphone.\n",
      "I didn't know whether they were of good quality when I ordered, but it worked out well. I would recommend.\n",
      "I've purchases several pairs in the past but they seem to grow legs and disappear into my son's cellphone or computer!\n",
      "The earpods fit nicely in my ears. The cords are made of a nice material that prevents it from getting too tangled up, and is fairly durable, and rather comfortable. The sound is very high quality for an affordable price.\n",
      "My old \"Apple In-Ear Headphones with Remote and Mic\" see [...] was worn out, so I decided to use the highly-advertised new model and move from the in-ear model to the EarPod.  (I bought it from a Verizon store since I needed it the same day.)  Regardless of what trick I used, the EarPods do not want to stay in specially when I drive.  I even went back and watched video from Apple describing how to put them in each ear, but no luck.\n",
      "Rough edges....already plug is separating....not worth the money...... Cheap knock off not worth returning.  Buy from someone else...not these people\n",
      "They sound great but I don't think the volume buttons words because pushing them and nothing happened. It's probably just the kind of phone I have.\n",
      "They looked great but the ear bud fell apart upon first use. The head phones have poor quality sound and microphone.\n",
      "The headphones are good quality and the packaging was original as well.  Overall, I am very satisfied with my purchase.\n",
      "Not the best... I could definitely tell how fake they were when I opened the box. The ear pod felt like plastic with strings in my ears. I dropped them once and they completely fell apart.\n",
      "Not Apple Product!!\n",
      "Exactly what i wanted. Best earphones on market. Way better than high end expensive headphones (beats) that break easy and make me regret purchase.\n",
      "Headphones came in what looked like a legit carrying case for real Apple headphone case. When I tried them out the headphones did not sound at all like the real headphones.\n",
      "When they arrived and I used them for the first time I immediately realized these were not original Apple hearphones. The bass is definitely not the same quality as the real ones. With some EQ they did well though, but after a couple months one side stop working. These are very bad quality earphones, and I wouldn't buy them again.\n",
      "I bought this item a couple of weeks ago and I have been using it all times...they are convenient and easy to use. Highly recommend.\n",
      "Finally!  Earbuds that don't hurt and I can wear for a long time.  The remote is a great convenience too.\n",
      "they send me a changer in stead of ear-pods. and charged me 20 bucks more than the charges worth. D)\n",
      "Good quality and clear sound. I rated with 4 stars because I bought the same product 5 months ago and it stopped working. It's too expensive for an accesory which has a very short lifetime\n",
      "The quality is decent for the pricing but the piece that goes into the phone began wearing off from constantly being in my pocket when riding a bike. This is an apple product and feel they should innovate it more to last longer than it should.\n",
      "YASSSS. I love these earphones so much. I keep losing them though.. this must be the 5th pair i've bought. :(\n",
      "Not sure if it was defective or packaged incorrectly, but the right earbud broke within the first day of wearing them.\n",
      "The headphones work great !! The shipping wasn't slow , and everything was perfect . However I have had the head phones for a long time now and you still haven't taken the money from my PayPal account .\n",
      "I ordered this product this week. The product arrived one week before the ETA :) Was nicely packed, no signs of wear and tear and the audio quality is just as good as of a new Apple headset that I purchased last year. In conclusion, a great Value Buy !\n",
      "Broke easily, just terrible. Do not buy at all please for gods sake don't buy this product for yourself. Lol\n",
      "Great sound quality. After about three weeks the top part of the left earbud came off and the wire ripped so it stopped working. The next week the same thing happened to the right side.\n",
      "I was told I'd get it a week later than I actually did. Major bonus! Exactly what I ordered and at a great price.\n",
      "Since my last earpods broke i decided to buy new ones, i searched for the right ones and decided to try these out. I though they were going to not get here on the expected day, but i was amazed on how the shipping went and it got here before the expected day. The sound quality was very good and and i'd be sure to purchase more if i have to cause it was for a very good price. I just love them (:\n",
      "IIRC these were labeled as \"used\", but upon receipt and opening...they're in mint condition.  Not a single molecule of ear wax on them.  They're Apple ear buds...they work just as well as all the others.  Gonna go listen to some stuffs now...\n",
      "They r very good, nice sound , u can use them( earpod) for years ,( I have the one that came wt my iPhone 4s) I have now the 5s . I order them for my son for his HTC. He is very happy. I still have mine. Why I didn't give five start is because I can not use them cause my ears start to hurt. So bad for me because the sound and durability GREAT..\n",
      "Met my expectations and provided in a timely manner.  Best to buy Apple product vs a generic as the quality is assured.\n",
      "They last for a long time and have very amazing sound quality and bass. I would definitely recommend this for anyone.\n",
      "when i first tried them out i immediately noticed how much better they are than the previous apple head phones. the bass quality is so much better than the previous apple headphone, also just general sound quality. they also block out most surrounding sound, creating a total immersion experience. i would recomend these to any one looking for good mid range headphones\n",
      "My husband uses his phone ALL the time and needed new earbuds. I had ordered a generic brand and he received a shock when he put them on so I went back to the Apple brand, He loves the fit and sound of the. You can buy generic brands cheaper but in my opinion when it comes to electronic accessories it is best to buy the name brand to make sure you get the quality you want and don't do damage to your electronic device. I had just seen a story on our local news of someone who bought a generic charger and it actually started a fire when plugged into the outlet and phone.\n",
      "Low audio-quality earphone/bud/pod substitute, with an Apple branding.\n",
      "I bought this about a month ago and one of the pods has stopped working already. It looks and feels like a genuine Apple product but in quality, not so much. For a comparison, I bought  genuine Apple earphones from a retail store for $29.99 and it lasted for two and a half years. So, I guess, you get what you paid for.\n",
      "Very poor quality the charger did not work for long & it seemed to take forever to charge! I guess u pay for what u get.\n",
      "Stay in your ear like no other\n",
      "Bought these for my sons birthday he loves them says they have great sound.Would recommend these earpods to anyone looking to buy great sounding earpods.\n",
      "They are a great fit for my ears and the sound is very good. I used them on an international flight to watch movies. Regular, free airline ear sets aren't comfortable nor do they transmit good sound.\n",
      "My cat, yes my cat, ate through the wire on my previous Apple ear buds rendering one ear bud mute.  These new one are much better in sound performance, comfort, and really like the remore and mic.  Let's face it, the size of the wire limits what any ear buds can do but these are much better than old Apple buds.  Will buy again if cat gets to them again.\n",
      "It has been less than a year and the earpods are already broken!!! apple was supposed to be a good brand, that must be a joke!!! very disappointed..\n",
      "These are exactly like OEM earbuds.  Perhaps they are.  They work exactly the same and have excellent sound.  Even better, the volume, mike and off-on controls work.\n",
      "These are my third pair and not because there was something wrong with it, it was because I lost them twice. I liked them so much I just had to get them again. The base is really good for apple earbuds.\n",
      "The description of these said they were genuine Apple, and they were priced like it. What I got was a fake worth less than 1/3 the price. . It may vary based on which seller it comes from, but it's not worth gambling on it. If you want genuine Apple, go to an Apple store. If you want a knockoff, Amazon lists others for under ten bucks.\n",
      "I broke my pair that came with my iphone 5 and ordered these. Exact replicas, same great sound and works perfect.\n",
      "Works good even though the mic part isnt working well, when ur talking on the phone. Overall price was good\n",
      "The sound is very good, but they are uncomfortable in the ear. I have to keep adjusting it b/c they kept falling out of my ears. I will try the ear pods next maybe.\n",
      "Fully working until now, control and volume. Reviews give them 6 months lifetime I will wait if this is correct.\n",
      "I bought the earpods as a gift for my 26-year-old nephew. He seems quite pleased with them, but I can't give you any specifics because I have not been around since he used them.\n",
      "Very good earphone of apple. The sound is perfect. Great quality. Work with any iphone, ipad or ipod. But personally i prefer the old  earphone design :P\n",
      "They claimed to be selling authentic Apple EarPods and what I received was obvious Chinese knockoffs.  I submitted a complaint and they refunded my money.  After refunding my money they asked me to leave a positive review.\n",
      "This product cam bran new and its performance is amazing. I'll give it full stars. I suggest it for everyone\n",
      "My husband has small ears and we've tried all kinds of ear buds for him, but they're uncomfortable. These fit nicely and they have an sound adjuster in the wire.\n",
      "This set is good and looks nice, but it is kind of dirty in the cracks. In general, I like it.\n",
      "Clearly fake... They broke on the 4th day; one bud split apart. I went to use a friends pair until I could get some replacements and immediately noticed the difference in weight of the buds. When the ones I bought cracked the insides revealed a noticeable amount of nothingness. Don't waist your money on these.\n",
      "All I can say about this product is it's a great purchase for the money paid.  I enjoy using them on a daily basis and they kick off some great sounds..\n",
      "Like the title says they are great! They fit comfortably and stay snug. Now with that said they do take time getting use to compared to the original head phones apple had. The ear pods actually put out bass sometimes they really do surprise me even now that I have used them since the day I got the iPhone 5! You will not regret the purchase.. These are the only headphones I really like\n",
      "These are my favorite Apple earphones yet. The sound is great, they're comfortable, and I feel that the shape allows for better, deeper sound without me having to press them deeply into my ears.\n",
      "There was a problem with the classic ear bud that I was hoping to avoid with these. After a while and quite a few workouts they came apart at the seams, maybe it was the moisture from my sweat. These don't do that and they function beautifully with one small problem, they don't stay in my ears when I sweat. Other than that they work well but I went back to the buds when working out.\n",
      "GREAT ITEM GOOD SOUND AND SO ON COULD BE JUST A TADD MORE STURDY AND HAVE THE FOAM ERA PIESE\n",
      "They looked new and on the case but only one side works... The other goes in and out a lot\n",
      "I received these as a gift recently and was curious to see whether I could use them as back-up for when I forgot my main earbuds. After looking at reviews all over out of curiosity (determining whether to sell them), I decided to give them a shot. Unfortunately I made the wrong choice. In comparison to other earbuds at their price range, they're not horrible in the sound area, but the comfort leaves way too much to be desired.\n",
      "For anyone interested in purchasing this product, please don't.  These are not, to the best of my knowledge, Apple ear buds.  The quality is nothing near the Apple ear buds.  When I recieved this product I immediately noticed parts rattling in one of the earbuds.  When I actually used the earbuds I realized that the sound quality was not the same as the Apple earbuds.  Finally, when I attempted to use the volume controls and speaker, nothing...it just didn't work at all.  This is a scam product and I would discourage anyone out there from buying this product.\n",
      "The earphones work fantastic with my iPhone 5s! The buttons are very responsive. These are built to last. I had my last pair for two years before my dog chewed the crud out of them. Hence I bought another pair and it works great. The seller sent them to me on time and as described. I can't complain.\n",
      "These shouldve been better. The mic and volume controls dont work on all phones. If you buy these with android intent, dont bother. Those control buttons do not work with android.\n",
      "Finally,!! earpods that stay in my ears.  So many just fall out, even the most expensive ones.  These actually have a good base allowance\n",
      "no matter what smart phone You may have these are great. sound quality is good and the way they rest in Your ear is unmatched by anything. no extra plastic required! I was sad that I put these in the laundry with My work out gear. I have since ordered a new pair, I couln't go back to the others.\n",
      "Fit my ear and didn't hurt after keeping use it for a long time. It is durable and  I like it.\n",
      "These are great earphones and are of good quality! One of the greatest advantages of these earpods over the old apple headphones is that it's more enduring; the old ones get destroyed if it touches water, for earpods you just have to shake out the water; this one is also more resistant to yanking of the lines as well.\n",
      "They really are very good headphones, the quality with which the music is heard is excellent. If you possess a good MP3 player that holds an adjustable equalizer, you'll notice that the headphones can be heard very well. I recommend them.\n",
      "Received these headphones a couple months ago. I use them with my android device. Haven't had a problem with them.\n",
      "The headphones were exactly as described, came in a carrying case, and have worked perfectly since I received them over a month ago. They were half the price of many others of the same model, so I am very happy with my purchase. They also arrived ahead of schedule. I highly recommend this product and seller.\n",
      "These came with my iPhone 5s that I bought about two months ago. I didn't really use them that much because I had already spent good money on a higher priced headset. I only used these earbuds at home on the couch when using over-the-head headphones would be uncomfortable. And then i figured I should stop bringing my headphones to school, so I began using my apple earbuds.\n",
      "These earbuds are great. I like how the shape fits more comfortably in my ear. Listening to music or talking in my phone, they have great sound.\n",
      "I do not like the newly designed ear buds at all.  They are too big for my ears and they fall out every few minutes when I’m jogging or even just walking quickly.  One would think that Apple could take some of their billions and hire some of the best engineers in the world to design ear buds that actually fit well in people’s ears.  I guess not.\n",
      "The new(ish) Apple EarPods are a big improvement over the old design - they are much more sturdy. Keeping them clean - especially the screens - is more work.\n",
      "Not only did these arrive super late - they also sounded awful and I used them for maybe an hour or two before I threw them in the garbage and continued using my old ones until I found something new. NOT RECOMMENDED.\n",
      "I have purchased various headsets over the years, claiming to be better than the rest but none have compared to the sound quality I get with Apple EarPods.  I don't need extra bass or any fancy name to show I am hip.  I just want a good product and this does it.  Great job Apple.  Why do I needs Beats by Dr. Dre or any other celebrity designed/endorse product if I get my music experience in pure clear sound right here.\n",
      "I bought these earpods used because I could not afford to buy the new pricing, and the condition stated \"Like New.\" The earpods worked the first time I tried them, and the second time there was nothing. The last and final time I tried it only one half worked. I was so disappointed that I did not keep them. Do not buy used.\n",
      "My original pair of these were perfect and i fell in love with them at first use. I thought the shape of it was genius and fit perfectly in my ear. However i broke the original and thought would buy another obviously i bought the Original brand thinking it should be the same but it wasn't. This one just kept falling out of my ear left and right. Sucks but I never used them again.\n",
      "These small, very comfortable EarPods are just what we have been waiting for - comfort, quality of sound, ease of use, reliability. In addition there is a built in remote that allows adjusting the volume or control playback or answer or end calls with a simple touch of the finger. Great for use while riding in a car or while out walking or jogging. The sound quality is exceptional. But of all the fine features we expect form Apple products, the highlight is the comfort of the fit in the ear of these EarPods. They just don't fall out at the same time being entirely comfortable while in place. Recommended. Grady Harp, April 14\n",
      "Worked well,but the plug had problems out of the box that left some static in the background. Otherwise, they are super comfy and perform to my expectations\n",
      "Not a fan of the side specific EarPods.  you HAVE to use the speaker in your right ear...  I typically use this in my left ear so I can chat with others in the car, it closes off opportunities for switching ears.\n",
      "someone modded them before selling them. real piece of s***. Mic doesn't work, wire was a strange grey, and the buds themselves were weirdly dirty.\n",
      "Buyers, beware! These will fall apart very fast. Aftter a few months of VERY MINIMAL USE all three pairs died one after another. Dont bother to waste your money.\n",
      "I bought this as a gift. My grandson seems to like it. I really don't know anything about it. ok\n",
      "Don't expect these to sound like pro headphones but for the price they are great. They look nice and feel solid like all Apple products. If you need a basic walk around pair of headphones these are excellent.\n",
      "The ear buds fit very well but the clarity is very poor- the set may have a defect in the wiring connection  as sound comes and goes\n",
      "Best ever. He sells original stuff. I ain't talking about old stuff that doesn't work I mean reasonable stuff do it.\n",
      "These things don't stay in my ear if I move around at all.\n",
      "love it it's very nice quality is very good recived it after a week very very nice love it much\n",
      "What more we need to say more the title it says it all we needed. Really good product.Apple product always have no issues.\n",
      "I ordered this product because apple products tend to wear over time. The photo depicted my old iphone 5 earbuds and the seller had great reviews; however, the product I'd received looked brand new and did not properly function. The buds themselves produce sound as if coming from a long distance away and the sound quality seems to be \"washed out.\" I'm not sure how this happened but the product I purchased and was advertised to me was certainly not - in its use - what I received. I'm very disappointed in that it took quite some time for this item to be delivered and the expectations were simple: that the product I purchased would function. I've unfortunately wasted my money.\n",
      "I loved this earphones they fitted great in my ears. There was great aspects of these earphones and they had one of the best quality types too. I wish I could have used them for more than a week because about half a week after owning them mine were stolen. No joke so whenever you buy these make sure to keep them safe because people will steal. Thats how great these are. BUY THEM!!!!\n",
      "I bought secondhand. It was broken only for a month. Maybe it was not regular one. If you wanna buy, you should check it is regular or not.\n",
      "They work very well and my daughter loves them. I would recommend anyone buying these. They are good for the money.\n",
      "Great iPods for my 13 year old grandson.  He says it's the best earphones with great bass!  Lives the earphones!\n",
      "Don't know how I happened upon this deal but THANK GOODNESS for it lol the headphones came in their original package and work amazing!!\n",
      "I've used & own over a dozen earbuds and still have most of them. Each of these has their own place depending on the application. The Apple earbuds don't compare with numbers of others even in the same price points in my opinion. The design of these buds makes it pretty much impossible to block out the external sound, thus there's no way to fairly compare them with other buds that block out external noise. However, these have advantages that others don't.\n",
      "I read the reviews, heard the usual suspects rave about how wonderful and fabulous these buds were and gave them a try. I then went back to J buds.\n",
      "i can hear the music very clear.\n",
      "Product is very good Apple products are always good and this is no exception.\n",
      "This item was delivered promptly, however, were quickly returned due to the overall size of the earplug. They were unccomfortable and did not fit well in the ear.\n",
      "If you are reading this, I would imagine that you have not had the pleasure of owning or using an Apple product at this point in your life. I have owned Apple products for the past 8 years and of all the headphones, these are the best! They are comfortable and don't have rough edges which I have experienced with cheap brands. The sound quality if amazing, and they have a remote for great accessibility for sound.\n",
      "I'm being nice with this review. So flat and unimpressive. Drivers experience distortion with modest low end frequencies. The only thing this pair headphones did not surprisingly fail at, was translating the electrical signal into recognizable audio/music and not static. #EpicFail #Audio #HiFi #Junkie - Buy a pair of Bose if you really want a worthwhile audio experience. #ThatIsAll\n",
      "They were a great price and fit my ears where others don't. I also love having the volume control it's very convenient!\n",
      "They are amazing i love them they sound great and are very comfortable there really cheap better than most headphones\n",
      "The sender said this item was in excellent working conditions, but it was not true. the microphone actually does not work properly, I can't adjust the volume from the wire, have to do it directly from the phone.\n",
      "The product works fine but it was not new as indicated. I had to clean the crusty earwax off of it with alcohol before I could use it. There was also hair stuck under the tape and the packaging was not in \"new\" condition.\n",
      "They come sealed in the original apple packaging so I feel confident I'm getting the real thing. They work and sound great.\n",
      "I find the performance excellent.  I think that for me there is not a significant difference in the comfort level, but I have big ears.  My wife thinks they are uncomfortable.\n",
      "The earpods have good sound quality, I mean good balance between the bass and brightness, so... good sound, good price.\n",
      "I just bought these. From the split second you first hear them you realize how crappy the old ones are and that you've now entered an entirely new world. I've had a lot of earphones, noise isolating ones, the old apple ones. These produce by far the richest sound I've ever heard. You can't go wrong with these, assuming they last a while. AMAZING SOUND!\n",
      "So glad I got a second pair with my iPhone 5S.  These are so easy to wear, sound quite good and make using my phone fun and simple.\n",
      "Ordered these after my old earphones stopped working on me, I was hesitant considering they are earpods, and I never used earpods before. I was surprised by the quality and effort put into the product! I love my new earpods, and use them all the time.\n",
      "I lost my other Apply earbuds, I think I left them on the plane or something so I bought these ones.  They are pretty basic, easy to use, and look just like the ones that came with my phone.  I am still using them after I accidently washed them and they're still pretty good.\n",
      "I first bought these in Vegas at the Apple Store. Now I'm buying more pairs for my wife and my mother in-law here on Amazon. When I was in Vegas I needed some decent earbuds for poker so I decided to give these a try. I haven't bought anything else since.\n",
      "I was a little concern when I saw that the earbuds where wrap in tissue and was but they were brand new work perfectly fine I will order them again from ere if I need to\n",
      "The headphones that were sent were not authentic Apple EarPods headphones. Instead I was given a cheap knockoff of the EarPods. The case it came in did not have an apple logo on it, the EarPods were dirty and looked used, plus they were poorly packaged. I would advise no one buy these unless you want a cheap, dirty, alternative to apples original EarPods.\n",
      "I bought a pair of these headphones because I heard that they were a huge step up from the older Apple headphones. Less than a month after I bought them, they are already not broken. Everything is still intact. They just wont play any music. I would not recommend buying these.\n",
      "The sound is decent as far as earbuds go. I ordered them because I misplaced the original pair from my iphone 5. But mine had a loose connection that caused crackling and scratching right out of the box, which was extremely disappointing and hard to look past.\n",
      "gift for my son\n",
      "I purchased these for my grandson to give his Mom for Valentine's day! They both said that the ear pods worked great. very clear sound. Fit comfortably in the ear.\n",
      "You would think that, all ears being unequal, earbud manufacturers would step away from a hard, one-size-doesn't-fit-all design. I guess my ear holes aren't average enough, because these get painful after while.  I really preferred the silicone soft buds - they were the best ever.  Stupid cats.\n",
      "These EarPods are GREAT! The main problem is that they come in a little bag, making them look like fake earpods... I hoped for them to come inside a closed apple earpod case, especially for this price...\n",
      "They are a cheap knockoff of the newer apple ear buds. They hurt while they are in your ears and broke after a week. Avoid these!\n",
      "Bought earphones just as good as these for 1/3 of the cost, the only half decent thing about these overpriced earphones is the packaging they come in because that's where half the money that your paying is going to.\n",
      "there great and all but, i just wish they weren't in such s***y quality. that's my only down fall with them,\n",
      "They came in a Apple box, but I think I received a knock off pair. The audio was terrible and they didn't stay in my ears when I ran. I am very disappointed.\n",
      "I bought these headphones for the sound, which worked brilliantly. There were two things wrong with this. I used these on the galaxy s3, and the volume up and down buttons didn't work. Probably because i was using an android. The microphone just make a whistling sound when i used it indoors. Great headphones, but i could only use them for sound.\n",
      "If you try using it with android phones using appropriated slot, it will not function despite just being an earbud with mic. Your caller will hear dead silence\n",
      "These are outstanding ear phones.  Not great for exercising for me because they won't stay in my ears.  Fortunately for me I only use them with minimal movement.  The sound fidelity is great and they are very comfortable.\n",
      "The earpods came quickly and in perfect condition.  Great timing and much appreciated.  My daughter loves them and she no longer has to borrow mine.  They fit perfect, comfortable.\n",
      "The microphone did not work at all. When I tried to use them to talk on the phone the person on the other side of the phone heard a high pitched buzzing and not my voice. I use them just for headphones now. I bought two pairs too and both  pairs the mic does not work. Do not buy if your looking to use them to talk on the phone\n",
      "Very useful and the Mic is great. Must be taken care of or they may break easily, however they're similar to iPhone 5 headphones\n",
      "Because these earphones are the best. The quality, the feel, the bass. Oh my gosh these are the greatest ones ever\n",
      "THESE ARE NOT ACTUAL APPLE, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY\n",
      "What a great product. I liked it so much I bought another pair after my first pair quit working at 2 months. Then my second pair quit working after three months. So on balance you are just renting these excellent sounding earphones if you get the same usage I did.Caveat emptor. Hope you had better luck than I did.\n",
      "Came without flaws. I have used it for a month and it works fine. Sound quality isn't outstanding, but it's fine for the average person. You won't feel like you are missing out.\n",
      "I was very impress with the high quality sound and the way these ear buds worked I think if your looking for something that can hold great sound and bass this is it.\n",
      "This Earpops are very good,,Good Sound!!!!!  worth it to buy it. this are original by apple. the seller is very good\n",
      "Bought these online so I didn't have to pay the expensive prices that you pay in the Apple Store. Great product, good as knew. I have not had any issues with sound quality or microphone usage.\n",
      "The shipping is fast, the quality is good. I like it. It is wayy better than the old apple's earphones. The bass in here is the bomb\n",
      "I'm not someone that writes reviews BUT after purchasing these EarPods I was very skeptical afterwards after reading some of the reviews about they not working shortly afterwards or they weren't the real EarPods etc. However that is NOT the case with mine. They were shipped to me in a timely manner and I live in Barbados, allll in the Caribbean. They were the REAL EarPods, completely genuine and they sound wonderful! They were worth the money and even cheaper than the Apple site and here. I would recommend this seller for sure.\n",
      "Ive owned countless pairs of the old style Apple earbuds and never liked the way that they performed. This new design not only sounds clearer, has better low end response, but also stays in your ear much better than the old style did.\n",
      "This is the second time I bought these and they have a very short life for the $25 that I paid. First ones were from apple so I cannot say that the reason is that they are fakes. The mic stopped working on the first one after about 3 months, and one of the EarPods has no sound on my 2nd pair after about 2 months. Not a lasting product by apple and overpriced. I wasn't even using them on a daily basis!!\n",
      "I bought these b/c I thought they would fit my ears better, according to the specs, but they still fall out as quickly as the old apple ones did.  All other features are nice, but useless if they don't stay in my ears.\n",
      "Maybe its because I got em for a good deal? They play nice and loud, but sometimes rattle, which is not a known trait among earpods.\n",
      "The mic occasionally works with a lot of static. I can hear thru the ear buds but the mic is a big disappointment\n",
      "I trusted you. And when you use these headphones, I realized that they are not original.I feel cheated by you.\n",
      "it broke within 2 weeks but the shipping was great it was fast. the product wasn't that great and the mic didn't work at all for me\n",
      "these were definitely apple earpods with remote and mic. just pure earpods with remote and mic attached. just pure earpod.\n",
      "Very good sound and functionality for a small price. Remote allows stopping , starting , up-down volume , skipping back/forward and the microphone can be used for voice memos.\n",
      "Bent to hard and I ripped the insulation near the plug in. Didn't seem genuine apple, broke way to easy.\n",
      "The sound is fantastic! The up down volume buttons don't control anything on my phone BUT I can have hands free calls.\n",
      "The new EarPods work much better than the original earphones. As with the old earphones, they still needed something to make them stay in better. They work great with ACOUSTIBUDS. That's all I can say...\n",
      "I've lost and replaced them more than I'd like to admit, but I can't go a day without them.\n",
      "These are awesome earbuds. Great sound and they are comfortable in the ear. They don't fall out like most earbuds.\n",
      "nothing special, nothing wrong, just your average apple ear buds. some people complain that it doesn't fit, it fits me perfectly.\n",
      "I personally think that it's ballsy to ask $30 for these headphones. The number one reason that I no longer use them is the discomfort. After a mere 10 minutes of use, I feel the pressure against my ear canals, and after 30 minutes I have to take them off. A second disappointment is the overall sound quality. Audio is very hollow, highs are very rigid and sharp, overall annoying. There isn't a trace of noise isolation, but that could be a good thing for some people, especially if used for exercise or other activities where you still need to be alert to surroundings. I'll do well not to compare these headphones to an expensive pair, because no, you can't expect much from $30 headphones anyway. But I've gone through a fair share of cheap headphones, and it's easy to see that these are just not worth the money.\n",
      "TIP: DO NOT PULL HARD ON WIRES. cause they gonnna rip off the earpods. overall good product. the sound isnt as revolutionary as i thought lol\n",
      "I have bought a few pair from various 3rd party sellers and with exception of one honest private seller most have been knockoffs so now I stick to prime sellers mainly. The most reliable prime seller I've found is DealTeacher. I received a cleverly repackaged used set. Obviously someone was trying to rip someone off and I was worried it was this seller. Not so as they replied quickly to my inquiry's and without having to send back the broken \"repackaged\" EarPods the sent out a replacement set. I doubt they did the repackaging as they deal in bulk and I know this stuff happens from time to time. Regardless replacing them every month or so gets tiresome. I'm talking about skullcandies and 2xl brands even although they do have excellent sound. Apple EarPods sound as good to me as the skullcandies and I prefer these when not using my LG HBS 730 Bluetooth earbuds.\n",
      "I am very much satisfied with the product and the quality! I feel that is that it is over priced but still I paid for quality, style and brand!\n",
      "My son needed to replace his lost EarPods - so order the same ones. Works and sounds great. Hey it's Apple. So it is good stuff.\n",
      "Bought these for my daughter when her original ones died.  She has a Apple 4 phone. They work great and she stated they are very comfortable which is important.  Nice price too.\n",
      "I have 3 cats that love to get ahold of my earbuds all the time. Before I had been given these as a gift I was using the cheap Rocketfish and Sony earbuds for like 14 bucks or whatever for them just to rip and tear within the month from my cats getting to them. It's really annoying, even when I put them in a safe spot, they would still find a way to rip and tear. I was going through them almost monthly, but when I got these they lasted a solid 9 months without breaking down on me. Sound quality was still great even up until then. I just bought my new pair again today, and I was just reminded how much I love the quality of music through them. I have never tested the mic quality though, but the remote is so convenient when you're on a workout. I love these! Just a little too pricey in my opinion!\n",
      "Great head phones they last long and sound awesome. but keep and mind the controller don't work with other prucdects only with apple prucdects but the sound still works fine.\n",
      "Apple has move than greatly improved their earbuds.  Their previous version were already the best around and then they designed these.  They are designed to fit in the ear and are contoured to the shape of the inside of the ear.  The fit is great, they are comfortable, and the sound couldn't be better.  Don't spend hundreds on Dre Beats when you can get these.\n",
      "works perfect with my I phone 5 !! I have not have any problems these earphone work great i recommend them for sure\n",
      "I ordered the apple earpods *with remote and mic* but i received the older version without the remote and mic, so that was disappointing.. but the seller was very nice and apologized for the mix up. i got a refund so all was well.\n",
      "I got exactly what I ordered, I have no complaints. I am using the headphones right now and they're great ;)\n",
      "Inexpensive, yet the real deal. Fit better than the old style and look better, too. There is nothing better than the original.\n",
      "My great grandson loves his EarPods!  He especially enjoys them while sitting in a deer stand while waiting for the deer to come out, he is enjoying his music.\n",
      "the shape of the earbud makes listening so\n",
      "These fit in my ears perfectly and are perfect for either just listening or for when you're holding a conversation with someone. The earbuds leave enough space in your ears so that other peoples' words can be heard. If you don't like that just turn up the volume. Great Bass.\n",
      "I was spectacle because I wasn't sure if these we're going to be authentic apple ear buds but they are 100% apple product\n",
      "These are the only earphones I like and my ears are used to them. I wish I could like a different set that doesn't stop working after a few months.\n",
      "These are a terrific upgrade over the old Apple earbuds, and one should no longer immediately consider launching these in the nearest trash can, Steph Curry-style. Audiophiles aside (i can't stand them), these are competent. The biggest improvement is the low end, where bass is now much more prominent. However, many audio products these days boast better bass, and I don't want people to overhype these earphones. They LOOK really good, because their predecessors sucked to begin with. Bass can be somewhat muddy, and highs and mids are average. And though Apple thankfully improved the design so sound goes into your ear canal, the earpods feel insecure. They've never fell out of my ears yet, but I've noticed many an occasion where I have reached up and fiddled with the fit, only to realize they were in place, and just felt insecure.\n",
      "They were great the ones they sent me first didnt work and i had sent them email if they could send me another pair since the other ones were broken and without hesitation they sent another pair within the week\n",
      "The head phones are not original and the first day of use it broke, in the specification tells that the head phones are original and it's'not\n",
      "Best headphones by apple, I'm currently using them right now. For their price they have amazing bass and sound quality.\n",
      "These ear pods work - you can hear and people can hear you.  I don't know if that is 4 star or 5 star but completely what I expected.\n",
      "I agree with some of the reviewers. I lost the excellent Apple earphones that came with my iPhone 4S and bought a new pair of earPods from the Apple Store (1/2014), the only model available, and ended up returning them a few days later. They are smaller than the roundish earphones Apple used to ship with iPhone, iPod a couple of years back and they simply did not stay in my ears. They kept falling at the slightest movement (which is bound to happen while walking or moving, unless you lay on your bed listening to music). Yes, they look cool and hip with a design that looks like it came from a wind tunnel, that said, now, the earbuds are so smooth that there are no \"edges\" that keep them in place.\n",
      "I'm always using earbuds to enjoy music. Its sometimes difficult to find a good pair of earbuds, never mind a with a good price. These headphones are honestly some of the best pairs I've owned. They're certainly durable, great sounding, and affordable.\n",
      "The earphones work very well and meets all expectations. I have used them extensively and have had no problems. Great product\n",
      "I agree with the previous comments that these pair of earphones are built to work flawlessly. And they actually do. Just what you would expect from Apple.\n",
      "when the item finally arrived, there was a small piece broken where the 2 earpod wires join together. Later, after further use (about a week) the side of one of the earpods broke off, and I had to glue it back on, which made them very uncomfortable. Durability is terrible. Also, they started sounding really bad about a week in. I know what 320kbps sounds like, and these headphones clearly can't handle playing high quality music. Don't buy these. I used to have earpods i bought from Apple and they were great, but I think these might be a cheap imitation.\n",
      "Well you would think so but Apple surely got the wrong answer on this one! I suggest you to invest in something else!\n",
      "Best earbuds ive ever used! Only problem is that they hirt a little after a while but i got used yo it after a fer fays of use. Amazing sound quality and well built. Buy it!\n",
      "These work great with my iPhone. Nice build and quality, and I love that they don't use the typical rubber ear buds.\n",
      "This item is a faked one the moment you use it ....it will only last for few hours and broken the next day...so PEOPLE PLEASE DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT....\n",
      "ITS A VERY NICE PRODUCT... IT CAME AS I SPECTED… I RECOMMENDED… QUALITY 95%... WE ARE USING IT WITH NO TROUBLE AT ALL 100% OK…\n",
      "These iphone, ipod, ipad EarPods with Remote and Mic are a very convenient piece of hardware to have on your person.\n",
      "These are genuine apple headsets and work as expected.  I bought a similar pair from someone on ebay and got a cheap fake.  Spending the $10 more was well worth it.\n",
      "They're great, sound quality is excellent. The ones I bought were actually a second pair and they're definitely worth the price.\n",
      "I have tried several different brands of replacements off of my boys iPod, and my Wife's Walkman, and different ones around the house,  and by far the Apple sounds the best with the cleanest sound with the best crispest highs and thumping lows, they sound the best for the money by far!!! These are the APPLE brand EarPods, be careful of the ones that list them for less than $29 because there are a lot of them listed for a lot less and they look just like the factory Apple EarPods and even say OEM or something misleading, but if you read the other brands description  I'm might say packaged by ??????, some other name than Apple, or in the description it might say not in Apple retail package, and that's because there's is not Apple Brand, and the knock off brand that looks the same, they are not even close to the same in sound quality so I have been told!!! To me worth spending a little extra knowing what you are getting!!! And they are about the same price here as what they are at Walmart.\n",
      "I still have issues just like the old headphones with the cables freeing at the joints, as well as having the FORCE the buds into my ear to prevent them from sliding out all the time. (Even then I still have them fall out occasionally!)\n",
      "In my opinion this is the best headphones with the best price.\n",
      "Great sound, great price, I couldn't ask for anything more... other than to not run them through the washer! Bought another pair.\n",
      "Super cheap... the sound quality sucks, and the buttons are really hard to push compared to the real earphones. Unless you just need cheap headphones with a volume control remote, I would not recommend getting these headphones...\n",
      "I got fake  headphones  or just a piece of crap  because the sound  was horrible.I did some research to find out that these fit the exact  description  of fake ones\n",
      "Perfect earpods does everything that is needed for my iphone.  Everything was great with my amazon purchase, thank you very much!\n",
      "Great sound. Love the in line controls. Very comfortable to wear, but just a bit loose, so that they feel as though they could fall out easily. So far falling out has not been much of an issue. The storage case is awesome.\n",
      "SOUND: Most reviews rated the sound quality highly.  They were right.  Perhaps even better than my \"Skullcandy,\" of which I remain a fan.\n",
      "Good for refurb product. A little weird to get used to if you haven't use this style of earbud before, and in the winter when walking over carpet in socks you can get shocked in the ear, so be mindful of that.\n",
      "I got my EarPods with my new iPhone 5c. Somehow, I was totally unaware that Apple had developed new earbuds until I opened the box. I was never a big fan of the old design because they were so uncomfortable to wear and the sound quality was really average among earbuds.\n",
      "I bought a pair for my boyfriend and I &; I love them! The sound is great &; nothing wrong with them so far!(:\n",
      "I bought these when I lost my old apple earpods, and have been very happy with them.  The sound is noticeably better, and I don't get sore ears when I wear them for extended periods of time.  I've used them for jogging a lot and have never had an issue with them coming out.  Great product!\n",
      "These did not fully work. The sound was average and the mic and remote did not work at all. Disapointed\n",
      "it is good earpods for the price. but the bad thing is i lost it after about two weeks since i got it\n",
      "These are the real deal.  They don't appear to be a knockoff, and work as well as could be expected.\n",
      "Love this product .. Never fails on me .. I would buy a another pair .. There are real apple headphones\n",
      "I purchased these for my wife and I can say she just loves them.  They are worth the money I spent.\n",
      "They work perfectly and are very durable I've washed and dryed them twice and they still work like a charm\n",
      "I ordered these directly from Apple Store\n",
      "I returned these almost immediately. The earpod shape was not a good fit for me, and the sound quality was only so-so. These HURT my ears and I could only wear them for a few minutes before I had to take them out. I ended up getting a pair of Monoprice in-ear headphones with a variety of ends for a better fit.\n",
      "My daughter really loves these had phones for Christmas, she swears by them. no other head phone will do for listening enjoyment.\n",
      "These earbuds fit very nicely and very good quality on sound and the remote works well, too. I would recommend\n",
      "I bought these for my teenage son for Christmas.  It broke the first time he used it.  Returned for another pair.  Same thing - broke almost immediately.  Returned for a refund.\n",
      "I have used Le brand earbuds before and they felt and sounded great!.......Then i tried these. I could not believe headphones could have such great sound! I have used apple's old earbuds and they do not fit my ear or deliever quality sound. These are a great improvement. I have small ears so they ocasianolly fall out due to the shape but they feel great. I could wear these for hours and forget i have them on. The microphone and volume buttons do not work for android (for those people wondering), but the middle button does work for google now (the program not stating it works now). They work on my windows computer great and are the best earphones i have owned.\n",
      "ummm good headphones but there is already a shortage in them after like the first week I got them they got a short.\n",
      "We love our Apple EarPods with Remote and Mic. We have the i-Phone 4-S which has the regular earbuds that don't really fit your ears. These are great and we love them very much. I see why Apple went to this design.\n",
      "I'm not even sure what happened now to the original EarPods that came with the phone. I just know that they ceased to operate.  I don't think I can blame the kitten, because it was before her arrival.  Suffice it to say, I was NOT going to go with a substitute here.  Been there, done that with the iPhone 4 and I think I went through 6-8 sets of the really cheap ones that I bought here on Amazon.  These are the true originals, and I'm glad I spent the money; they are well worth it.  Yes, they tend not to go into the ear, but who cares? The sound quality is great, they work, and there you have it!\n",
      "These are a great buy, they sound much more expensive than they really are plus they are way more comfortable than the first generation earbuds.\n",
      "i'm not sure whymy daughter wanted only these because I wanted to just buy her a cheap generic pair she swore by these ones and I bought them and they are they are not functioning properly so I have had to buy a normal generic pair just from the store after ordering and waiting for these to come in the mail. Not to happy.\n",
      "these fit my ears best.  I wish they were less expensive, since my cats like to chew the cords.  I've gone through 2 pair so far due to cat-play :(  I like the audio volume control on the cord.  I use on my ipad & for talking on my phone hands free.\n",
      "Yes I got these for a 10-year-old... but the left earbud was broken within a week, and she's not that rough with her things. They went straight into the trash. The sound quality sucked, too.\n",
      "They fit very nicely and have a great, full sound. The remote does not work with anything but Apple products (not a big deal for me), but the mic works fine if you use it for talking on the phone.\n",
      "Works well as expected of Apple products.  Fits in ears, sound quality is great.  Apple products are always reliable. Thanks,\n",
      "I love these headphones.  I do a lot of Mt biking & listen to JANGO while I ride.  These headphones let you double click to go to the next song, increase or lower the volume, answer a call, put the music on pause all while riding a bike thru the woods.  Awesome - Buy it!\n",
      "I chose 5 stars because these were perfect~just what he had asked for! I would definitely recommend. A great gift for someone you love or for yourself!\n",
      "In my opinion, these are better than the standard open-style ear buds.  They stay in my ear better, and give much more detailed sound.\n",
      "Wasn't so sure I'd like the new design for the Apple EarPods, but they fit in the ear better than the pervious style and are more comfortable.\n",
      "My grandson specifically requested Apple Earpods.  They are the most comfortable for him.  He' tried other brands and been disappointed.\n",
      "These came in with my mom's iphone 5 so its genuine\n",
      "I only use them at the gym and my last ones must have gotten sweat in them or something. I've been using these for about 5 months and they still work great. I even sent them through the washing machine and dryer by accident and they still work perfectly. Great for talking on the phone too; no one has ever had a problem hearing my with them.\n",
      "Nice ear pods, I can hear and be heard well when using them, no complaints so far. I have not really use the remote, so I cannot comment on that. The new design feels really comfortable inside the ear, it really makes a difference from the traditional circular earbuds. I recommend these.\n",
      "I like the sound quality of EarPods and the fact that they don't easily come off my ear. The mic does not work with my Nexus 4 though, which was a bit disappointing.\n",
      "This is not an Apple product or Apple quality…this item just looks like an Apple product but is a rip off from China.  Sound isn't great and took over a month to receive.\n",
      "When I got my new I-pod it came with a pare of these ear pods and they are comfortable and you can even sleep with them in without having ear pain.\n",
      "Gotta love these headphones. They break to easy though. Usually at the jack part but thats an easy fix .\n",
      "This is great, comfortable, great sound. You can keep headphones in a case and everything; these will do that static pop in your ears after three months and die in four or five. Keep your money\n",
      "when I recieved the item, I got the wrong ones and I was disappointed, I emailed them the error, got an immediate response and said I got new ones shipped again. waited for awhile and tracked the shipment. Finally got them, and super happy about it!\n",
      "these broke on me after not having them a year.  controller on them doesn't work and an earbud died. pos\n",
      "The EarPods have great sound quality and it is very convenient to have the remote on them. I have had these for about a month and they are working fantastically. I had another pair of EarPods and they only lasted about a year before one side of them stopped working. It remains to be seen how long this pair lasts, but so far so good!\n",
      "Great purchase ! The sound is very clear and crisp and the controls  are a plus. :). Appears to be a good quality of a listening  device.\n",
      "These stopped working days after I got them.  One of the ear pieces had no sound coming out.  You'd think with how much money I paid for them, they'd be a better quality and have lasted a little longer.\n",
      "These are not genuine Apple Earpods.  They are fake!  Terrible sound quality - not even close to the genuine Apple earpods.  Don't waste your time ordering!\n",
      "Mine came with my iphone. I have had in-ear,on-ear and over the ear headphones and have had the chance to try out some bose and beat headphones too. The audio quality is really good and i have been ill treating my headphones in all manners, in gym, at work, throwing them around. The plastic shell around the speakers are good material but gave in to my torture and little pieces have broken off it. I wanted to clean the inside of the headphones and i had nothing at my disposal but a chop stick, so i put it in there and pushed it so hard that metal covering of the speakers are a complete mess. Then i put them in my ear and to my surprise they still sound the same. My point is they are darn reliable and i plan to buy a pair once i completely destroy these with my habits.\n",
      "Absolutely love the sound quality of these ear buds great bass and rich highs and lows. The fact that the whole ear piece is touching the ear and sort of fills the ear cavity makes it not only very comfortable but it also drowns out a lot of outside noise and it the makes the bass more invigorating and rich! Recommend to anyone who needs really good ear buds for a very very good price!\n",
      "I broke my original set of apple earpods with remote and mic.  I was relieved to be able to replace them!\n",
      "I bought these earpods a while ago, and they are still working great. I bought them refurbished and they look like genuine apple earpods from the apple logo on the case and it says on the lower end of the wire in small print \"designed by apple in California\" so I think I can trust that these are genuine apple earpods (i wrote this because I read a review doubting the \"genuinity\" of this product)\n",
      "My son loved this as a Christmas gift.  He says its better than other earphones.  They arrived nicely packaged and on time.\n",
      "These are HORRIBLE fit, quality, and they sound awful.  I no longer have an iPhone after dropping a few and crying about it over the years.  But I DO remember how nice the earbuds fit on my older iphones.  So when I needed new earbuds, these were a logical choice.\n",
      "don't understand the claims on this thread that these are knock offs. hardware and packaging is identical to those found at apple store only these are $10 less. i just added these to other items in my order and got free shipping too.\n",
      "The headphones didn't sit in my ears as well as my friend's pair of EarPods, which he bought from the Apple store.  A clever knockoff?  Probably. Especially at this price\n",
      "The EarPods have issue with the microphone, People can't hear me well, I'm not sure why, but I'm not using it on an Iphone (I have Nexus4) so probably it'll work better on one.\n",
      "People really couldn't hear me and one ear is out already I Carrie mail and I need some real durable headphones\n",
      "Headphones quit working after a couple of weeks. I would expect more from Apple but I guess they overcharged and under delivered this time.\n",
      "This product is still going strong.  I would buy this again.  There was no difference between this and the originals.\n",
      "I ordered this product because i needed a new pair of ear buds.  These work even better than the earbuds that came with my iPod, if you can believe that!  I am very satisfied.  A word of caution: Do not order multiples of the same item on one order. I recently ordered three items, but they shipped only two. I'm still trying to get them to straighten this out. Christmas is now going to be very stressful.\n",
      "These were the real deal for a good price!  I use them often, daily in fact.  Like this style ear bud over the previous type.\n",
      "My daughter prefers these EarPods to the ones that came with her iPhone, and it was time for a replacement set.\n",
      "I had a $530 plus pair of Shure earpods. Incredible sound but because they formed a seal with your ear canal [sic?], eventually they rotted and fell apart [I would go to sleep at night so this was pressing their limit]. These are plastic, do not form a great seal so won't give you quite the performance as a $530 set will, but they are MORE than adequate, especially for about $30.\n",
      "Simply worth the extra money.  I have two sons and a husband that all use apple earbuds. Since they get lost (left at other peoples houses mostly I suspect), I was trying to buy less expensive earpods...every brand I've tried was a major fail, not working after a few days to a couple of weeks.  From just not working to them actually pulling apart where the connectors were to the iProduct to the earbud pieces coming apart!  The apple earpods are durable, trips through the washer in a jeans pocket, no problem, still working just fine.  I've just told my family to please try and stop losing them!\n",
      "Product is overrated and overpriced. Quality is identical to the $5 earphones I was looking to replace. The $5 pair was also way more comfortable. Planning to return immediately for a refund.\n",
      "They have a nice sound and came on time. You get the same quality of the headphones that come with the iPhone 5. They got a four because they constantly fall out at the slightest tug.\n",
      "I've owned 5 pairs.\n",
      "This product was a good buy for me. I have no complaints thus far. Also the music sounds wonderful - its not some cheap headphones on the street side.\n",
      "The product stays in my ear securely, even when I am at the gym lifting weights or out on the trails doing five-mile runs. The sound is clear as well. I like that the product comes in a neat little package for storage; this prevents the frustrating tangled mess that we often create by throwing our electronic wires into  our pack. Like all ear buds, the pieces do catch wax, so clean them regularly. I recommend buying the \"like new\" versions for a more affordable deal with the same quality.\n",
      "This item works great for the right price,\n",
      "This item is good as its description and delivered fast. It's fully recommendable. You would enjoy and love this item.\n",
      "I have purchased two of these, connector brokes too easy. Apple must verify the quality of this very expensive earbud with a cheap plug.\n",
      "I love the sound that these headphones project. They are very comfortable and the microphone works great while talking on the phone.\n",
      "Love them . work well. other can hear me & I can hear them. I would recommend this ear piece over the cheaper ones for sale. I bought a few of the cheaper products & this ear piece is much better\n",
      "Falls out of my ears too easily.  I thought Steve Jobs tested on thousands of people?  Sound is great though!\n",
      "Great sounding ear phones and yes the fit comfortably!!! I lose these so often that they should come out with a \"find my headphones\" app.\n",
      "If you are willing to spend this amount, then buy Apple EarPods. Most earphones put the sound into the flat part of your ear where as these direct the sound into your actual ear. Has a nice mic and volume controls that work well. Also it hasn't broken on me yet which is a huge plus (6 months).\n",
      "I lost my EarPods and somehow washed my husbands.  I wanted real ones, so I paid the extra money to get the real ones.  Quick delivery!\n",
      "These are not good headphones. Right away I felt that something wasn't quite right, and within a week they were broken. Don't buy if you expect real apple headphones.\n",
      "There's are much better than their predecessor. The bass is incredible. I would have never thought you could pack so much sound into these things.\n",
      "They worked really well for a few weeks, but they started to crackle. It could be that I had them in by backpack every day, or maybe a low build quality. But the pair I bought from an apple store went through the washer and dryer and still work well (As well as the backpack treatment). Worth the buy.\n",
      "These apple earpods are fake. Please save yourself disappointment. I expected them to be fake anyways, but it was worth a shot. The quality of these are quite pitiful as well. Nothing compared to the real thing...\n",
      "This came late, they  gave me a refund and I would have gave them an excellent review if it wasn't for the fact that one of the earpods doesn't sound as loud as the other, it's very uncomfortable to use and I stopped using them...\n",
      "Love these headphones. Great for use in the car so that you are hands free. I use them all the time.\n",
      "all was ok thanks, I was I requested, all was ok, thanks a lot for all, I will buying more\n",
      "The world's most uncomfortable earphones. My ears ache after wearing them for an hour. I am a 180cm with normal size ears. I feel really sorry for the 150cm person with small ears.\n",
      "yes i like apple products but these lasted less then a month for me and im forced to spend yet more money on a new pair\n",
      "These pods are genuine apple. They are the real deal in the full case at what you expect to pay for them. Fantastic... nuff said.\n",
      "if the EarPods are made in the US they're 4-5 star HOWEVER, if pairs come made from China, they suck! After one week, you lose the volume control, ability to skip songs, etc. VERY disappointing! But I got what I paid for for just $5 each - but a waste of $5. Back to full purchase price of $25-30 each...\n",
      "Bought this for the boyfriend and it worked just great! I didn't want to spend a fortune on ear pieces since he loses them quite a bit but this one worked great.\n",
      "Talk about the FAASTEST SHIPPING!\n",
      "i like this apple ear Pods with Remote and mic are really nice and it is a good product for\n",
      "These are AUTHENTIC Apple EarPods for sure :) Bought these as a Christmas present just a few days ago (had to give them to whom I bought them for, I couldn't wait I was so excited ;) ) and they LOVED them! I got these in 3 days total from J&R Music & Computer and they shipped them out with tracking & they got here so quickly! The quality is excellent and sound is amazing, plus everything works as suspected to :) Truly an Apple product for sure so do not worry if they are fake or not. I will definitly buy products from the company I bought them from again for sure, Definitely a 5 star rating!\n",
      "this product is terrible they came broken in half and are not apple there are reverse engineered ones and i could not even get a full refund\n",
      "These are great earpods that work well with my Apple products and with my Kindle Fire as well.  Highly recommend.\n",
      "Sounds much Better than the Original, but still doesn't always have the Best Fit, depending on your Ear size. Fits good for me Though.\n",
      "These are expensive, but they work. The cheap knock-offs are not the same thing. I really like the shape in the ear and the sound quality is quite good\n",
      "Yes it is original ! The original Earpods are EPIC ! Don't buy cheaper fake ones !\n",
      "It is Original ! Best sound ever , don't try to buy cheaper ones. sound is unbelievable ! Great fit & isolation it okay\n",
      "These were bad . They are not the original apple ear phones . They are the imitation ones . I was disappointed with them\n",
      "Excellent earbuds for my purposes. I needed some new apple compatible ones for general use and these fit the bill perfectly.\n",
      "Within 2 days of using, the left ear bud already went bad. I know that they were cheap... But you would expect to get more than one days use out of one. Not worth buying.\n",
      "I needed new headphones for my iPhone and I purchased these out of necessity and they are alright. I would probably go with a higher quality next time i need to purchase headphones.\n",
      "These headphones were good for about two weeks and then I could get no sound from one ear , if you want these headphone just get the apple ones\n",
      "great sound Just ear wax builds up in openings and you have to clean regularly. other than that great. awesome\n",
      "I love these things. Im a BMI Songwriter and these are the only high performance earphones that actually fit in my ear. earbuds never have fit in my ear. I use these to hear all the intricate sounds needed to properly mix a record being pitched. A must have for anyone serious about music\n",
      "Get these.\n",
      "i love these earpods! It sticks in my ear and the sound quality is awesome! and the controls on the right side are just perfect. :)\n",
      "Doesn't fit into my ear well. New design sucks. I often need to push into my ear. I feel conventional ear pod designs are far better.\n",
      "These are the original Apple ear pods. Well fits in my ears. Probably best ears phones by apple. I like these\n",
      "simply dope sound, mic works great, I use em in the car, mowing the lawn (not to talk on the phone while mowing of course).\n",
      "Sound good but hurt my ears. I like the old Apple earbuds better. Others may have a better experience depending on the shape and size of their ear.\n",
      "these sound awesome and fit in my ears and dont hurt like the old iphone ear phones. Stay in place when I work out too.\n",
      "These earphones are the BEST! The volume is just great for my ears and I never have problems with it. The size is no problem either.\n",
      "NOT SUPPORTIVE OF MY GALAXY 3. IT DOES NOT ANSWER OR LET YOU CALL OUT. I COULD NOT USE THE VOLUME. COULD PLAYBACK EITHER . FOR $30.00 I AM VERY DISAPOINTED\n",
      "ok earphones but a little too small for my ears and a little expensive i think as well blah blah\n",
      "Pros: no loose parts to lose.\n",
      "They are really good ear phones and fit in my ear very nicely and don't have high highs and low lows.\n",
      "These things are FAKE. They are not made by Apple and although the sellers themselves are friendly and have good customer service, I have now been duped into buying 3 pairs of fake headphones. I guess the only way to get the genuine ones is to order directly from Apple.\n",
      "Fit your ear much better than regular ear buds. The sound quality is excellent too. Work better than regular ear buds.\n",
      "I brought these headphones on Jan 10 th 2013, it is now Nov 30 th 2013, and they are still going strong. I've dropped them in water, I've sweated like an animal with them in my ears, I've had them ripped out of my ears, and crushed in the bottom of my bags. I have never had a pair of headphones last more than a month. Not even the Apple headphones that came with my iPod then my iPhone. These are the best headphones I have ever used. Strongly recommend!\n",
      "I love EarPods however, I was very disappointed that the volume button and  pause/play button.  I won't order these again.\n",
      "The ear buds are constantly falling apart and have done so since the 3'rd week I've owned them. Cheap Chinese made product...What a shock -.-\n",
      "While Apple tried their best they missed the mark. The old ones are better, stay in your ear while these tend to fall out.\n",
      "haven't used it yet but it seems good and the box is not opened. i guess i will enjoy it\n",
      "Got the product in a day. I bought earphone before online but that was different from the ads. This time its totally the right stuff and i have used it for half a year, quit good.\n",
      "Earbuds are personal, but these work for me.  Finally apple \"got it.\"  I actually prefer these over some of the more high end earbuds from Shure, Bose etc.  The reason- you can stuff these in your pocket and the little buds won't fall off- much more durable.  Also, you get clear sound, but you can still hear what's going on in your surroundings.\n",
      "These earphones work great!  I also like the new shape of the buds. They seem to for better than the previous shape.\n",
      "My item was indeed the official Apple product - that is what sellers should be shipping from this listing.  Sounds like some people are getting knock-offs.\n",
      "I tried returning this and it was not an apple product. The seller never got back to me and these headphones fell apart in my ear. I was sitting down doing office work and I received a shock and my headphone fell apart. Do not buy... Just go on Apple.com instead it's the same price and you never know when you might get a fake product. Sound quality was really bad as well. Everything was faint from start to finish.\n",
      "I really like these headphones. Earbuds in general are pretty hit-and-miss when it comes to quality, but these are definitely worth purchasing. The audio quality surpasses that of any $30 pair of earbuds and beyond. I like these even better than a $200 pair of Bose headphones I have because the sound is more balanced and consistent. You truly feel like you're listening to music the way the artist intended.\n",
      "I like the pods themselves, but they don't go back into the included plastic box very easily, so I threw that away.\n",
      "Only earphone that doesn't irritate my inner ear, I guess because it does not have any rubber or plastic?  Sounds great even compared to other higher priced earbuds.\n",
      "This is definitely an improvement over the older pack-in earbuds, mainly in bass and the ability to remain in your ears without have to use rubber inserts.  It's nothing significant, but for the price they are not bad.\n",
      "Sound good, apple product, I use them everyday no problems, and I would suggest if looking to buy apple headphones best out of all the styles.\n",
      "Bought this to use with a Nokia Windows Phone.  The clicker doesn't work with my phone.  The old style earbuds from Appple worked so I when I need new earbuds I thought I would try these out.  Turns out they are not compatible.  The sound is pretty good though.\n",
      "Not worth the disappointment. These worked briefly, with sub par quality, then finally one side died all together. I submitted a claim to the seller but recieved no contact or instructions for return, I was ignored.\n",
      "The headphone is sometimes defective and provides either distorted sound or sound only from one lobe at times. I've noticed this multiple times and is shocking in a product that costs 30 bucks.\n",
      "I bought these for my son and they must be awesome because they never come out of his ears. He told me the sound quality is great and he likes having the mic on the wire.\n",
      "Original stuff, liked it much. The difference between apple and any other brand is better sound response in terms of volume.\n",
      "Don't ever buy this!!!! When I first got it I thought that it was really good but then after about a week the earbud was breaking and the sound skipped listen to the reviews!!!\n",
      "After a couple of days one side of the earpod didn't work anymore. The mic didn't even work as well I wanted to be everytime I would use it the person I talk to would be like sorry I can't hear you. I would have to hold the mic up to my mouth which was very annoying.\n",
      "The sound quality is great on the earbuds, but the mic is terrible. My girlfriend was constantly asking me to repeat myself. It's not worth it for any phone operations.\n",
      "Works great no issues\n",
      "It works well with the IPhone 5.. I also use it to listen at music on my laptop and at my desktop\n",
      "Crap. If they went thru the trouble to revise/enhance their product you would think they would have tested it.\n",
      "Great headphones. Overpriced, but what else do you expect from apple. These stay in my ears much better than the older apple headphones and i love having the remote and mic to change the song and volume without having to take my iPod out of my pocket. For the best deal you can always find pairs on eBay or craigslist brand new for under 20$\n",
      "The earphone came in a very good case. However, it doesn't fit well in my ear canal; this affects the amplitude of the audio I hear.\n",
      "Nice looking, decent sound quality, but does not stay in my ears very well. For the price, it is a good buy .\n",
      "I just ran my earpods through the washing machine for about 10 minutes until I realized I left them in my pocket. Ran to the washing machine, frantically pulled them out-- all my clothes well-soaked in detergent at this point. Threw them in a bag of rice to help it dry out for a few hours and lo & behold: still working like a charm. Just popped in some Daft Punk, the bass and all the rest of that good stuff sounds absolutely pristine in these earpods. Tested the mic and it's all good.\n",
      "So much better than the original ones I got with my older iPhone!  I can now hear music over engine noise on a plane.  And, they are very comfortable and don't fall out of my ears.\n",
      "Great headphones, especially for the occasional workout! Fits perfectly in one's ears. This is how all in ear headphones should be built! Sounds quality is what you'd expect, with decent sounding bass.\n",
      "why do apple always make earphones that are too loose? is it that hard to a take a trick from sony's book of any other brand there, I like the design and the sound is okay, the mic is quality as it doesnt pick up the movement of clothes while its rubbing against your chest. but they just ruined it by the lousy fit...\n",
      "Good sound quality. The bass sounds like the original Apple ear buds. I'm happy with it compared to other lousy ear buds that do not have any bass at all.\n",
      "I like these headphones but I don't think they are as amazing as Apple wants you to believe. I like them better than Apple's previous model, but wouldn't buy them again if I lose them.\n",
      "It's good & better than regular ear phones. But Apple should produce some best quality ear phone like beats & others.\n",
      "These are the original Apple EarPods and have a great price, sound, comfortability, and microphone! They sound better than Beats.\n",
      "These Earpods DO NOT work with the IPOD shuffle 3rd generation as it previously stated it did. I had to contact Apple myself to find out if indeed it would work with Ipod 3rd generation and after a 45 minute phone call and search of their products now in stock, I found out that they no longer carry the old version of Apple Earphones which does work.(Amazon does still carry these new Apple Earphones- just put in \"Old Version\" along with description).\n",
      "I have both the older Apple EarPods and this new style pair. I've read reviews that say that the new style sounds better but I can't confirm that. They are both pretty good. This new style pair has a slightly longer cord, which is good, and comes in a protective case, which is good. Recommended.\n",
      "If these headphone did not come with the Iphone I would not own this product. The price is astronomical for a pair of headphones. I love high quality sound and I have owned various set of headphones and the quality of sound produced from these seem to be the exact same quality as some of the headphone that cost 1/3 the price. Don't get me wrong, these are high quality headphones but there are high quality headphones for cheaper.\n",
      "These earbuds are really comfortable and I like being able to answer the phone without taking them off. The sound is good and they also don't make my ears hurt like some earphones.\n",
      "Best earphones for the price. sound is great and not too loud to bug others in your surrounding. I had this before and lost it and i did not hesitate to buy a new one.\n",
      "Great product. I recommend getting these headphones because they work so well and I do not have any issues with them.\n",
      "This apple earpod doesnt sound to good like the original one I dnt no why I purchase earpod on amazon\n",
      "They look like the real Apple headphones but they're not. They broke in like 2 weeks and the sound quality isn't the same as the Apple ones. The microphone doesn't work but the volume buttons do. When I say they broke, I mean like the cover fell off but I was able to snap it on. It keeps falling off, but I can still snap it back on. Overall I think they're decent. I just wanted them to look like the real ones.\n",
      "It was not Apple Brand , but cheap knock off ones. supposedly theirs an echo when i talk with the mic. the mic design is rubbing off. the sound is good. but not Apple quality. you can tell from the cord at the plug end. theres a little writting that says \"Made in China\" as opposed to \"Apple designed in california, manufactured in China\"\n",
      "Hey, its by apple. These headphones have a little more low end sound than the old ones.  These are better than more expensive aftermarket.\n",
      "The cord was separated from the the ear pod itself. Not good qualitity and took forever to get so was not worth the bother to return. Just won't buy from the user again\n",
      "These headphones are the real deal! The sound and look is great and has met my expectations. A true apple product!\n",
      "The headphones work well. They have the exact same quality as the apple headphones. Its took a month to ship but I am happy with my purchase. The buttons all work just fine, the quality of the music is normal. The ear buds themselves feel a bit hollow? Possibly a little light? But thats not a problem. These are pretty great headphones for the cheap price that they're asking for. But like I said, the shipping did take a long time.\n",
      "I recently started using my phone as a media player again, and as much as I love around ear headphones, I needed something I could just fit in my pocket, so I went with ear buds. Coming across the old problem of them not staying in my ear, I remembered the old Apple ear buds had an excellent fit to them, so I purchased these new, improved versions. After testing them out, I was sad to discover that the new design made them fall out just as easily as every other ear bud I had tried. The saving grace with these is the sound quality is excellent for in ear headphones. The volume controls weren't working, but I'm using them with an Android so I can't really count that against them, as they were designed for Apple products. Overall, I'm not too happy with them given the price tag. It's only $30, but you can get some pretty good ones for cheaper, and of course every smartphone now days comes with a decent set. If you are looking for a set of ear buds, these certainly aren't a bad option, but I would look into companies like Sentry first before making a final decision.\n",
      "Apple EarPods wire connection on the headphones falls apart very easily if you travel a lot with them.  Would not recommend them for the cost...there are better solutions that cost less.\n",
      "These headphones are great! I'm not a huge audio buff, but I think the sound is good. My ears never hurt, because of the comfortable EarPod shape too which is nice when I want to wear my headphones for longer periods of time.\n",
      "I'm not sure if these are a counterfeit product or not, but I notice a difference in quality between these and the ones I have since bought directly from Apple.  The differences are subtle but apparent.  My Apple EarPods have a little mesh screen over the sound hole ports... these do not.  These have an uneven seam apparent on each bud, my Apple EarPods do not.  The button action on the remote is certainly different.  The buttons on the remote unit of myApple EarPods are snappy.  The ones on these suspicious replacements barely work at all. Worst of all, the right ear bud has a distorting buzz when I make phone calls.  My Apple Ear Pods do not.  Something is wrong here...\n",
      "These headphones have great sound quality.  I like the speaker configuration.  My only complaint is they are a bit expensive.\n",
      "Received the item on time and was as described.  The earpods have a good sound and the remote works great. Have difficult time keeping the earpods in my ears while working out. When I can keep them in my ears they are comfortable.\n",
      "It is good,I like the new earphones. It is same as before.I love it.It is really cool and good.Thank you\n",
      "Always the best!\n",
      "I love these headphones for the Iphone. They are ergonomically designed to fit in your ear and direct sound directly into your ear hole, whatever its called. Probably a little over priced\n",
      "In under two moths of use, the microphone is no longer working. I use these often, but take good care of them. If this product cannot be manufactured to last, it should be priced accordingly.\n",
      "The earpods were not 'brand new' as described, felt cheap when compared side-by-side with erapods that came with iphone, and had something loose inside the left earbud.\n",
      "They did not last very long at all and are not very comfortable. Big let down. Only reason they get a 2 is bc the sound quality was decent.\n",
      "I have had my headphones for a couple of week and never used them until a few days ago. Within the week only one side of my ears were working. There are a fake\n",
      "When you search Amazon for Apple earphones you get a lot of listings that are not made by Apple.  Even when you select only Apple brand in the left boxes, a lot of impostors show up.  These are the ones that came with your new iPhone.  These are exactly like the ones your puppy just chewed up.  They have that great bass sound, the easy fit, and that handy inline controller for volume up/down, call answering, pausing audio, and launching Siri.  The box is genuine Apple with that classy design, with the box within a box that is molded to hold only these pods and nothing else.  So beautiful, so perfectly designed, I will never use it again...and yet...hard to toss.  Genuine Apple.\n",
      "The sound is so much more different from the last earphones I had. I really like these it has nice quality.\n",
      "Amazing design. Earbuds have finally been perfected. The use of air holes in the speaker casings give an amazing amount of bass and creates a sound that is comparable to most over-ear headphones. Since buying these I have stopped considering to buy an extra over-ear pair of headphones for a better sound. I have had mine for six months and they are still good as new. This design holds up better than older Apple earbuds, they are also much more comfortable.\n",
      "These earbuds have pros and cons.\n",
      "They fit perfectly and they are much more comfortable than the old apple earphones. But they should be worth less in price value.\n",
      "Sound quality is absolutely amazing for buds that just sit in your ear and don't actually dig into your ear canal and blast sound directly into your skull. IEMs feel really invasive for my ears, that's why I like Apple's buds because they are very comfortable while providing decent to good quality.\n",
      "They broke after 2 days of usage. Gave them to a friend and he told me they quit working after two days.\n",
      "The sound is great so long as you get a good seal with the duct tape that you need to hold them in your ears.  Didn't think my ears were that unusual... Now I'm all self conscious about my ears.  Maybe I should get more colorful duct tape.\n",
      "I've gone through 2 of these in the past year alone.  It is prone to breaking and the fit is weird at first but having grown used to them, I now hold a disdain for in ear earphones.\n",
      "They don't really fit my ear canal well. They fall out of mine and I needed over the ear or on the ear headphones.\n",
      "I've always had a problem with finding ear buds that stay in comfortably without me shoving them into my ears. When I ruined my ear buds that came with my phone, I decided to go with these because I wanted the ear buds to be able to control my iPod. I love how these can sit in my ear comfortably all day long and I don't feel like they are going to fall out or cause me pain if I don't remove them. Great job on this design Apple- the best!!\n",
      "These are not Apple EarPods. The sound quality the headphones produced was much less than what I expected, and after further analysis I found that these are not the same as actual Apple EarPods.\n",
      "Sounds great, i use it to run too, they dont fall! well almost never, great product from Apple, nice price.\n",
      "very good this earphone. the acoustic is also very good, and this fits perfectly in the ear. recommend it to other users\n",
      "They were fine for the first couple weeks and then suddenly, out of literally nowhere the left EarPod went out, and I could no longer hear from it or use them. But thanks anyway.\n",
      "I love these earphones! The sound is great! And I love the way they fit in my wars, they don't fall out! Best pair I've had!\n",
      "These are the best head phones I have ever bought. They don't fall out when you run and the bass is astounding. A must buy for anyone looking for a good pair of head phones!!\n",
      "... The audio quality is good...but far from the great which Apple claim. Disappointed. Overpriced. Will not purchase again. Shame.\n",
      "I lost my original apple earphones and purchased this one hoping that it would be the same.\n",
      "My wife has tiny ears and loves using these as opposed to the original earbuds. Solid sound and good microphone.\n",
      "The delivery time only makes the situation even more irritating. After I finally received it, the left ear bud\n",
      "Apple did a fine job on this design. They fit me very well and sound very good. I used them only once. I was very impressed with the sound they produce. Go Apple!\n",
      "These ear buds are very comfortable. The sound quality is really good, crisp highs and rich base. A good but.\n",
      "Sound great!, but it keep falling off my ears maybe my ear size didn't meet what's their called STANDARD. Real uncomfortable to wear when sleeping. :-(\n",
      "As mentioned these earpods are not apple made. I could not return it as I had asked my friend to get it from me from US.\n",
      "These ear buds are pretty pricey but they're totally worth the money. They have an AMAZING sound and quality to them.  They have gone through the washer and dryer and still work good as new.\n",
      "It's been a while since I had them and they are amazing quality AMAZING! EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE A PAIR OMG THEY ARE AMAZING!\n",
      "These earpods are the best in ear headphones ever to be made I like the way they sound you can here bass and quality in the earpods the design is awesome you should get a pair of these\n",
      "These earbuds are very good for iPhone or in my case I pod touch so if u dint hv them get them now\n",
      "I love these earbuds.\n",
      "not comfortable, but then again i've got small ears. Regardless, gels are so much better for fitting and sound quality.. yeah.\n",
      "I'm not an audiophile or expert by any means, but I just wanted to warn other potential consumers about fit and slippage.  I constantly have to adjust the headphone piece for my right ear.  It is always slipping out and it's very annoying.  I can even feel it losing traction and falling out when I make movements.  Maybe it's me, maybe it's the headphones, but I know what I am feeling and what I am feeling is utter disappointment and extreme annoyance with the overall usage and fit.  As far as the quality, the bass and treble are very nice and it is a huge upgrade over the last pair of apple headphones that I've been using.  It has a very pure and clean sound and this makes me enjoy my music even more.  I like the headphones very much, but with these problems I won't be buying another pair of these again.  It's really unfortunate because there were so many positive reviews about the fit.  In short, buyer beware about fit and slippage.\n",
      "Original product, works well, however, it is a little pricey. There may be other cheaper products that may work as well. I was looking to buy original products so didn't look at alternatives.\n",
      "These are great for running and for keeping the noise out. the old earphones used to fall out of my ears when I ran but that does not happen with these. And I have no trouble hearing the music no matter how loud the traffic is.\n",
      "Love these new headphone.  All earbuds I've ever owned before hurt my little ears, but these fit amazing.  This is the 2nd pair purchased, that's how much I want them with me.  The sound quality is not Beats by any stretch of the imagination, but if you are looking for a decent pair of ear buds that is actually COMFORTABLE, this is a great purchase.  This new design took too long apple, but thank you for finally getting it out :)\n",
      "The shipping was very fast, but these aren't the real deal. Mine broke in a week. Bad sound quality, they're only nice if you're trying to show off that you have these headphones.\n",
      "I purchased this item from RainbowAccessories_Tech. I received it within the normal time frame. Packaging looked fine. It even looked like legitimate apple earphones. I was suspicious when I took them out of the package because they felt light and the inside of them rattled unlike my original set that came with my phone. When I tried to use them I was disapointed to find that one side did not work at all. I contacted the seller and they told me to try it again as they had \"tested them before shipping\". Not sure how as they were sealed but I tryed them in another product and they still did not work properly. I contacted them again. This time they stated that they could give me a 75% refund and that I wouldn't have to ship them back( they came from china or japan). I was quite upset as I have no use for a set of earphones that don't work. I gave up and told them fine but I was going to state this in my review. I then got an email from someone stating they were the manager they were sorry I was not being taken care of and please don't write a bad review. So No only did the headphones not work the seller is terrible as well.\n",
      "I have had these headphones for two and a half months now, and they are the only headphones that haven't broke.\n",
      "These earphones are the best earphones that Apple has made thus far. As far as I've seen, they are extremely durable; the pair that came with my iPhone 5 survived being both washed and dried, and the pair that I bought from Amazon survived being sucked up by a vacuum cleaner. I also think its worth mentioning that I use these in the shower a lot (albeit I don't get them actually wet, I keep my head dry as I use my phone in its waterproof case, the significance of this being that they frequently survive The 100% humidity.)\n",
      "These earphones are very comfortable, they have good sound and the mic works well.  I don't have anything negative to report.\n",
      "After 2 days remote crapped out, bad product, what a joke, 30 bucks for crap. Will be using my old ones.\n",
      "I paid for two extra pairs and mine keep getting stolen or lost.\n",
      "I received the ear buds just yesterday day..even though my mother received them several days ago, but that's okay haha. I  this product so far...I can't tell if the material is plastic or of some sort of other material though. Its a concern to me because I want something that will be durable for a long time, but like anything else treat it as best as possible. I yet to find out how this product works with surrounding noises- or if it can block other noises while listening to whatever audio\n",
      "Okay, these earbuds came with my iPod...  with the statement that they rest in, and stay in, most ear types comfortably.  I apparently have an unusual, a-typical ear type, as they kept falling out.  I can't say anything about the sound quality, as I couldn't get the buds to stay in long enough.  Very frustrated that I will have to spend yet MORE money on another set of buds, trying to find some that will remain in my ears.\n",
      "Less pain on my ears than the stock iphone ones..  But volume way too low on Galaxy (I blame android tho)..\n",
      "Even though this is a big improvement over the original EarBuds, I wasn't thrilled at first because they would fall out when I worked out. I know this will depend on the shape of your ear, but my ears must not be EarPod friendly. The EarPods would even jar a little loose when jogging so the sound wasn't as good. Fortunately, I came across SPRNG clips. They only cost $10, and they hold the EarPods in place. Now, I get better sound and comfort from my EarPods than I get from all the other $100+ aftermarket headphones I bought in search of a solution.\n",
      "always love these headset compare to the old ones, these kick balls. just love the way it looks and works, only problem, hate clicking the clicker to switch songs or rw song\n",
      "Amazing sound from these buds! Although a student dropped them on my desk and the right bud exploded apart in three pieces. It was easy to reattach the pieces.\n",
      "I'm too old to be fooling around with this stuff - but I am.  I'm hearing impaired and found that the ear buds definately help, but I do NOT understand what remote and mic mean.\n",
      "I find these earpods rival many on/over ear headsets I have used. The in ear shape is very comfortable, stays in place during exercises.\n",
      "This set of air plugs was purchased after considerable research. I read the warnings about the fact that the buds do not comfortably conform to many users ears; one size does not fit all! If I were one of the lucky ones whose outer ear matched the target ideal, then I would be rating this product a five star value - not because it was any cheaper at Amazon, but because the speakers and Mic quality are a bargain at this price. Do not plan to be physically active while using this product. Great for plane, train, and automobile trips.\n",
      "I bought these headphones and within a week they had broken, second pair of apple earpods I've owned, and both pairs broke, very disappointed!\n",
      "i've owned these earpods for 8 months and now they don't work.  One ear is completely out!  The sound at first was awesome.  They were comfortable to wear and didn't slip out  which is always a problem for my small ears.  Not sure if I will buy these again because of the short life.\n",
      "I bought these to replace a pair of earpods that came with my phone several years ago. After one month, the right earbud just stopped working. No clue why and I wasn't able to fix it. Frustrating.\n",
      "IT DO NOT WORK AFTER SEVER MONTHS, AND I COULD NOT CHANGE IT,  IT MAKES ME FEEL SO BAD, I WILL NEVER BUY IT AGAIN.\n",
      "Horrible. Just another knockoff of the real ones. Waste of money. I do not recommend for anyone. Rather just pay for the real ones.\n",
      "They were missing the vital bass component which is the key to most my music. I just wish that they were just........better really\n",
      "I go through several a year due to me catching the line on items in the yard like limbs, mower handles, rakes etc.\n",
      "apple is three things classy, classy and classy. This thing is cheap but quality product. Sound is good for average user like me.\n",
      "They are the Apple Earpods. They came on time and they work just fine. I personally love the earpods more than any other headphones.\n",
      "These are some of the more comfortable ear buds I have used, and they sound great! I adjusted the sounds a bit, and I am surprised by the quality of both the bass and treble. I have been using Skullcandy (most recently) and a few other name brands. While these are a touch more expensive, so far I like the sound better. The mic/controls work as they should. So far they seem to stay in the ears firmly without getting uncomfortable after awhile. Wore them a couple of hours the first day, more than I normally will in a stretch. Have not tried during heavier activity but I will update in a day or two if there is a problem. Oh, and there is a right and left bud, important for fit. The storage box they are shipped in is even nice, just unwrap the cord first and pay attention to how the wires come out so you can put them back in properly.\n",
      "Standard issue iphone ear buds that come with the original phone. will fit in every single case so thats a big plus\n",
      "Awesome product. I've had these over a year and they still work well. fits snuggly in the ear without causing irritation.\n",
      "the headphones are good but i believe they shouldn't called them \"apple earpods\" because they lack of quality with the originals\n",
      "I love the EarPods . Much cheaper through this company than the apple store. A must buy through them you'll love them and the price\n",
      "Not cheap but these are worth it! They make music so much more enjoyable! Very crisp sound and great base sounds !!\n",
      "Best earbuds headphones I've ever used.  I have oodles of ipods and there are bunches of cheap apple crap earbud headphones which come with them.  They are crap and I give them away.  I used Shure E3Cs for my good music listening.  I tried these out just for kicks and they are awesome.  Will they replace my E3Cs ? NEVER but for a set with mic which I can plug in and make a quick phone call with my Android phone they are fantastic.  I use them with Skype on the iPads too.  If I was stranded on a deserted island and needed a music fix and these were the only headphones available ? they would do just fine.  Best new thing from Apple I've seen since the iPad.\n",
      "The new apple headphones feel great they aren't as bothersome as the predecessors. They are very comfortable and don't fall off when I go running\n",
      "This works the same as the OEM product you get with an iPhone 5 but is 5 dollars cheaper than buying through Apple.  No brainer here.\n",
      "The sound quality is really bad & The right ear bud & remote stopped working the morning after they were delivered.\n",
      "Maybe I have weird ears but I can never have earbuds in my ears for a very long period of time.  This at least are an improvement on the old model. They stay in and don't fall out all the time and I love the controls.  As far as earbuds go in my love/hate relationship with them, these are great.\n",
      "The headphones, themselves, are great... The audio is nice and clear, and it's very solid.\n",
      "The average American now carries at least one electronic device on them at all times. The device can range from a cell phone to an mp3 player. In recent years, people have been able to enjoy both the aspects of a cellular device and an mp3 music player with the new smartphones that are being developed. They allow phones to contain fun and useful applications, music, and be able to make both regular and video calls. With this new technology, simple headphones or headsets are not able to keep up with everyday demands. Smartphone owners looking for a pair of reliable, high-quality headphones should consider buying Apple's earpods with remote and microphone despite the accessory being made mainly for Apple devices.\n",
      "I love the way they fit my ears. My ears are small and these are very comfortable. The bad of it is that the end wire breaks to easy, I am on my second pair and will not buy this type again I will look for one with an angled input.\n",
      "They stopped working. The left ear-bud died on me on the second day that I used it and I was taking good care of them -__-\n",
      "They are to slick. I keep thinking I should plasti dip these in hopes they stay in. Everything about them works great, but what good is it if they won't stay in your ear. They are very uncomfortable too.\n",
      "I choose this rating because I cannot find any dislike about the EarPods. The sound quality is excellent and the new ergonomic design fits great.  Would definitely recommend.\n",
      "these Apple earpods with remote and Mic are awesome I love the them.I use them all the time they sound great while listening to music what talking on the phone.\n",
      "Does not provide adequate volume both receiving and transmitting. (I can't hear and the person I am talking with can\"t hear me)\n",
      "doggie ate my other headphones, generally as good as any other headphones, they match my iphone 5 (in white of course)\n",
      "I love the form. It fits into your ear without hurting after a while. The sound is good. I can recommend it.\n",
      "I only wish my phone had come with these in the first place!  Rest easy in my ears and give fantastic sound. I put them away each time on the spindle they arrived on ( hoping to prolong their life)\n",
      "Brought these for running. Great sound my only complain would be that I ordered becuase they said they would not slip out when running , however, my right one constently does this :(  If that could be corrected they would be perfect.\n",
      "I was very nervous about this product, but when I received it, it was in the sealed retail packaging and I was extremely pleased with the shipping time as well as my product. Thank you.\n",
      "My son loves these and is very happy. I dont much care for them but they work well and are Apple product.\n",
      "These Pods are great because of the remote and they are much more comfortable than Ear Buds. I use them for my Ipod and I love the fact that I don't have to constantly take my Ipod out of my pocket when I go into a store of if I need to talk to someone.  I can just pause it by pressing on the button.  Very cool and innovative.\n",
      "These little earbuds produce a high quality, good sound.  If you are a larger person, these may be a great value.\n",
      "As good as usual. My old one(with iPod ) is broken, so I brought this one. I really like it.\n",
      "I've bought several pairs of these because I like them very much but cannot keep them from getting lost or accidentally left in pants pockets in the laundry...\n",
      "I just got a new iphone and was really excited to be getting a set of these, as the ones that came with previous iPhones always fell out of my ears. Maybe I just have small ear holes or something because these fit even worse. I am really disappointed because they seem like much better quality than the old ones. I held it to my ear with music playing and it sounded really good but I could never actually wear them for any amount of time. They literally fall out of my ears immediately. For comparative purposes I am an adult woman.\n",
      "This is the second pair of Apple EarPods that I have purchased. They are crafted so poorly. This is the second pair of earpods that I've had that have lost the sound in the right ear. I don't know why I'm paying so much for earpods that only half work after a couple of months.\n",
      "These earbuds have a really nice sound and fit well in the ears.  I really like them for my iphone.  The dangling mic can be hard to hear, especially if you are out and about.  If you are in a quiet room, and your listener has good hearing, should be fine.\n",
      "They work so perfect that i prefer these than other past earphones i used and they are really worth paying for.\n",
      "I like the EarPods and they are great for listening to music. However, when I use them for the phone they are not clear. People on the other end often tell me I sound muffled. They were listed as refurfished, so I wasn't expecting a brand new Apple set. They did arrive on time and well packed. Overall, if you're not very picky then this pair will be great for you. I'm very happy with them and they meet my expectations.\n",
      "Best headphones ever, no complains, i have been using it for 7 month and it still works perfect . .\n",
      "This is my second pair. First pair I had for about a year then the right side stopped working. I ordered my second one and less than two weeks later my mic and volume controls just stopped working.\n",
      "Terrible sound quality.  Spend a few more and get a real Apple EarPods.  These sound so bad, I threw it away.\n",
      "These still work great after 6 months of heavy use and being carried in my blue jean pocket.  They have even been through the washer and dryer a couple of times and still work like new.\n",
      "Maybe my ears are different sizes, but for some reason, I feel like the right side is uncomfortable in my ear. Left side is fine. I think it is the \"seam\" that runs across the top, between two different pieces of plastic, it isn't as smooth as it could be on that side, and so combined with a tight fit it can be a bit painful after long use. But otherwise they're fine, they do stay in better while running than the older models did.\n",
      "Much improved ergonomics relative to the last generation ear buds.  Fit comfortably in my ear, microphone was much improved.  Cord was a little longer than desired, but it's not big deal.\n",
      "These are great. I love them. No problems. Very good sound. Works great. No issues. Never had a problem. Always worked fine.\n",
      "I have had 4 or 5 of these Apple EarPods, and they are excellent!  I always took them for granted - that is, until my last pair broke, and I purchased a set of Zeimax Earphone EarPods to replace them.  The Zeimax only cost $6, (about 25% of the cost of the Apple version), so I took a chance on them.  Now I know what good audio sounds like, after comparing the Apple EarPods (excellent sound quality) to the inferior Zeimax EarPods (hollow and muddy sounding).  Also, the Zeimax were lighter, they rattled when shaken, and they broke after four days, (the right EarPod fell to pieces); whereas the Apple EarPods are solidly made, and they last much longer.\n",
      "These ear buds are much more comfortable in my ears than the previous generations. They don't do much to cancel out ambient noise, but because I use these while walking on busy streets, that might be a good thing.\n",
      "I will say that I used the \"old\" Apple headphones and settled with them because I could not find a nice alternative. I hated the cheap, flimsy design and knew Apple could do better than that. I finally found some other brands that were cheaper and sounded nice, but they broke within 2 months. Later, I settled down with Skull Candy's Ink'd line because they were easy to find and affordable. The problem with those was that the sound quality was average.\n",
      "I bought this for myself, I love the way they feel in my ears, very comfortable, they came sealed in those transparent boxes which you need a chainsaw to open. hahahha they came with manual, stickers.\n",
      "Poor sound quality, bad construction, broke within a week of purchasing them. Don't even bother buying them. Not worth the money. Not an apple product.\n",
      "I received the headphones and the volume control did not work, nor did the microphone. I was really disappointed with the product.\n",
      "They were not apple OEM. A knock off that didnt sound all that well. If you look at the cord at the base of the jack, there is no writing where it should be on the OEM headphones. Sound quality is very poor\n",
      "I purchased two pair for me and my husband for our iphone 5's. They worked great.... They are the original. Great price!!!!\n",
      "I ordered one some months ago that broke. I happily ordered another used pair from the same vendor. The new ones were packaged in a way that damaged the headphones a little. It had problems within the hour, losing contact on the right earphone. I was really disappointed by this.\n",
      "These have just OK fit and OK sound quality for me.  Nothing great, but they were the right price.  I found that the volume control doesn't work with Android devices, and they don't stay in both of my ears well - strangely, they stay in my left ear just fine, but fall out of my right ear.  I might look elsewhere for my next pair.\n",
      "Maybe they are stylish, but they hurt my ears after about half an hour. Looks like I'll have to actually spend some $$ and get some decent, padded ones. Sound quality is fine, but that's of no use if it it's uncomfortable to use. I do have small ears, so maybe for others it wouldn't be a problem.\n",
      "I bought these headphones because I liked apple headphones in the past. Well, these are uncomfortable. I find myself carefully removing from my ear because of discomfort caused. I can't keep them in my ear for more than 30 minutes without feeling bothered.\n",
      "WOW. Well if you only plan on using these four times in your life then these are the headphones for you. THEY ARE KNOCKOFFS. They fell apart less than a week after receiving them. They are not made by apple. Go to apple.com if you want to buy these headphones. I had thought they were made by apple. They even resemble the same packaging as apple when you receive it. BUT ITS NOT. DO NOT PURCHASE!!!!!!\n",
      "I've been through a lot of earbuds, snagged and broken the cords. These have been through the same rough treatment and they hold up. Not the very best sound you can get, but for everyday use they're my go-to buds.\n",
      "Absolutely the worst headphones I've ever brought. To cheap and the sound is very muffled and quite. They broke like my third day receiving them in the mail. Just horrible. And the mic doesn't even work. I wish I could get my little refund back.\n",
      "These came all the way from hong kong but are the real deal. Perfect replacement for rage ones I ruined by leaving in pants pocket during wash.\n",
      "Not sure why my right ear doesn't work as well as the left, but there you go. When I have used these pods while walking or gardening, the right side works loose. I think they sound very good.\n",
      "You can tell these were repaired bc they will not go as loud as my other pair of apple earpods. But it still gets the job done.\n",
      "I guess I have smaller than normal ear canals but these definitely stay in better than the previous version of the apple ear buds. I bought apple specifically so I could have a hands free option when driving.\n",
      "NICE\n",
      "I go through headsets about every 6-8 months since I use them on a daily basis for phone calls / meetings. These have worked great with my HTC One X and are holding up well to the torture that I put them through every day.\n",
      "purchased these 4 months ago, and they are already broken, with not much use at all - the wiring is poor, I guess.\n",
      "headphones broke apart in two weeks. doesnt feel like the regular iphone 5 head phones and the sound is pooooor.\n",
      "Bought these for my son and he just loves them...even let me try them and I loved the sound...crystal clear.\n",
      "They were exactly what I wanted and for a nice price . They also got to me pretty fast, I was very excited .\n",
      "i bought these ear pods for my iphone5 and they work great! i guess I will see how long they last because it says it's \"apple\" but i have a feeling that it's generic because it was so cheap!\n",
      "They didn't want to stay in my ear and I wished I did more research before I bought because Apple ear buds are notorious for losing sound as they age - better off getting less expensive non apple buds and tossing them as they break.\n",
      "These Apple EarPods are the most comfortable ear buds I have ever used. You can not go wrong with these.\n",
      "Love them. They work great no matter if I'm going for a run, talking on the phone, or laying in bed. Great product\n",
      "If top of the line quality and absolute user security you have to get these unbelievable EarPods! They are cheap at twice the price. Even though these cost me more than I would typically spend on a pair of earbuds I can hear the obvious difference in sound quality and i love the way they fit my ears! I really can hardly tell I have them in my ears at all sometimes!\n",
      "The right ear bud went out and then again.  So we got another one and it went out again, but it lasted longer then the 30 days so we couldn't return.  We are sad.  Looking to buy another brand.\n",
      "out of the box looked fine and was able to listen to music with good quality but,,,,,,\n",
      "These earpods are pretty good quality, and what I like most about them is their durability. They have survived many drops, as well as trips through the washer. They fit comfortably in my normal-sized ears, and they stay in pretty well most of the time; the only time they've come out is occasionally when I am running. The remote that is attached is very convenient, whenever I use my other headphones I reach for it, only to find that it is not there.\n",
      "not good at all headphones for Samsung galaxy s3 are better or Sony headphones at Walgreens for like 10-15 u.s dollars...WoW its like im listening to my grandma...\n",
      "I have a gs3 but I hated the headphones it came with the phone so I have been using the apple original headphones but then I lost them. So I ordered these headphones they are really comfy in the ears and the sounds are good too\n",
      "I'm sure the sound quality is superb, afterall these are made by Apple, however they come in one size only, I think Apple could offer these in more than one size!  They're way too large for my ears, they won't even stay if I sit still.  What's nice is they sell for $29.99, so I resold these immediately for $20.  I'll use that to buy some comfortable-fitting earbuds.\n",
      "My first pair of these earpods lasted for about a year. I think that is pretty good for earpods. These have great sound, good controls and are super convenient.\n",
      "To me, the quality of Apple's packaging and products is top tier.\n",
      "IF YOU BUY THESE FROM NEMOJU EXPECT FAKE EARPODS... IT IS ADVERTISED TO BE THE REAL ORIGINAL ONES BUT EVEN THOUGH THEY LOOK THE ORIGINAL THE SOUND QUALITY COULDN'T BE MORE HORRIBLE. IT HAS NO BASS AND IT SOUNDS LIKE ONE OF THOSE HEADPHONES THAT THEY GIVE AWAY AT A FAIR FOR FREE.\n",
      "hello, I have tested my new hearpods, I like it a lot, their sounds is sharp and clean, I recommend for all apple users\n",
      "I have bought many earbuds and headphones before but these earpods were a revelation. I hear sounds that I never picked up before with any of my other equipment. I bought these on recommendation from a friend and after reading some reviews. I expected quality but nothing to that changed the music I listened to so drastically. I went from a pair of Ripcurl Earbuds (Which I thought were pretty good), the original Apple Earbuds from the 3rd generation devices and I also have a pair of headphones that got a 4 rating from Sony the ZV100, these are better than those. I would recommend these to anyone looking for a cheap pair of earbuds, they are worth the money hands down. On top of it the microphone and remote are great, though the remote only functions on the volume and pausing the music it's still handy to have. I don't write reviews unless I really believe a product is exceptional, this is an exceptional product. Avoid the naysayers you wont be disappointed.\n",
      "Well at first these ear buds were great!  However after about a week of having them the volume goes down on its own when I'm on a call or listening to music.  It's very aggravating.  Especially when I'm running on the treadmill.  Has good sound when the volume stays put.\n",
      "Definitely i don't like this product. I bought this one as description was manufactured by apple. It is not true. This is  a duplicate or original in $15-20. I won't even buy this for $5. Doesn't have sound quality at all.\n",
      "Great sound, Just the Same as regular Apple EarPods, No surprises, I love the sound. I'm glad these weren't a ripoff.\n",
      "For the past 2 days, the price of these earpods have fluctuated. I noticed that in the morning (9 or 10 EST), they sell for ~25 dollars and after noon EST, they sell for ~30. Save yourself 5 bucks and order these in the morning :). I just ordered mine this morning for $24.95. They were $29.99 last night.\n",
      "These earbuds are awesome the sound clarity is great deeper bass they but out twice the sound of my older ones which were the oem buds that came with the iphone 4 once I saw the price drop had to get I think they were originally 60 $ so they are worth it\n",
      "It is very good , but for me It is a little bigger on my ear , so better to have sizes of it , but overall it is very good\n",
      "I got these as a backup set of headphones for the office and they work just as well as the ones that came with my iPhone.\n",
      "These are perfect! Apple earphones are the best earphones for my IPhone. The sound is so clear and crisp just as it should be.\n",
      "I have used these since they came to market. My first pair finally let go. I use these all day at work and they take a beating. After 10 months of use they died. i just ordered these and they are just as my first pair used to be. If you do not want canal buds give these a try. They are very comfortable and stay in my ears pretty well.\n",
      "These are the best earphones I've tried so far with the iPhone.  The sound quality is improved over the ones that originally came with my iPhone 4 and they are comfortable.\n",
      "The product was exactly as I wanted but the shipping was a full two weeks longer than I anticipated.  Overall happy\n",
      "I purchased these and love them. Good quality sound and great price.I love the added mic, definetly a good value\n",
      "After 2 months the right speaker stopped working. Return policy doesn't allow me to return for a new pair. Duds.\n",
      "It seems no matter how much money I spend, or what brand I buy, I cannot keep earbuds for more than six months. I decided to buy these apple ones after my previous two choices only lasted for three months. However, the plug bent within a week and the sound quality wasn't that great. The worst part of them is that they aren't that comfortable. I longed for the soft silicon tips of my other earbuds.\n",
      "My boyfriend bought one months ago and he did it again cuz his father want one.. The music sound great in the earpods.\n",
      "The best earbuds that I have ever used. They fit comfortably and have great sound. They worked great until my cat chewed them up.\n",
      "i never write reviews but feel compelled--remote button doesn't work....seems to be a fake apple product....I should have just bought the real thing\n",
      "It broke without reason a couple days into my careful usage. I was very disappointed. I'll rethink my choices more wisely from now on\n",
      "They work, and he really likes them. I, however, thought they were WAY overpriced, but then again, it's an Apple product. At least there's this: it wasn't my money.\n",
      "I have not spoken to anyone, but I am very dissapointed with my experience because the apple earpods did not work . I should have know better than to trust something used , but I really thought amazon would have check out the product before it was sold, I did return the item because it would have cost me more.  I will never by any more used items from you again.\n",
      "The button to adjust volume fell off within two days. The headphones wires were exposed and were very vulnerable. Not good quality at all. The sound was fine while it lasted though.\n",
      "one of the best headphones. Take this one if u need smth light and which can be used everyday coz they r good\n",
      "The quality of the earpods are amazing, much better than the old model. The bass is excellent and this is much more comfortable in the ear. This is a good buy for the value on amazon, highly recommended from avid music listener!\n",
      "apple earphone shave a bad reputation, but all my devices are apple so what the heck, this new design is my favorite so far! the case is super cute too\n",
      "Ear pods are the best buy for any apple product where headphones are needed. They are Very durable with quality sound.\n",
      "These really are a huge improvement over the former apple earbuds and as good or better than all the comparable models out there I've tried. Keep in mind they are still earbuds, you aren't gonna get a headphones level of quality. I still highly recommend them if looking for a simple but strong and reliable pair of buds.\n",
      "Great sound with much more low end than the original apple headphones, and the case it comes in works as a handy travel case instead of simply being disposable.\n",
      "I had been looking for headphones to wear while sleeping, these headphones are great for sleeping. These don't trap sweat, have full and surprisingly good rich sound and impressive bass response without sacrificing sound quality. My only complaints would be the cord is a little on the short side if you're really tall, they can be a bit hard in your ear till you get used to them and the cord has a concerning way of twisting up that I'm concerned might damage the copper wires inside or break them internally. I found the headphones with ear gels are the most comfortable but I worry that the tips come off inside my ear canal. These one piece won't have that issue. If you have two different sized ear canals as I have found I have these won't fit as well as the ear gels do. They do a great job of being shaped to better direct the sound into your ear.\n",
      "My experience with these were not that great because they did not last a week for me.\n",
      "the sound of the buds is fantastic when together, but the left earpiece has almost no volume by itself. unsure if this is just apples design or i got faulty headphones\n",
      "They worked just like any other new apple earpods would. I would definitely buy again. I give this five stars.\n",
      "sounds great, looks great, fits great. Needs a longer cord but as usual Apple is quality. These are better than the old earpods.\n",
      "It works well. I've been using it while I'm running or working out. And I had it for over 4 months, it still working great\n",
      "really good quality item. much better than previous generation earphones that apple supplied. i don't know yet how long it's going to last. but as far as i see the materials been used to make in this earphones, it should last long.  i've got white iphone 4 and it matches with the phone perfectly. Also very impressed with the sound quality. It fits to my ear perfectly, first it was strange to put it into my ears, but i used to it. this is must have item for those who want to buy good quality earphones.\n",
      "Headphones stopped working after a week and a half of use. Not real Apple Ipods. One headphone gave out after a few days, don't waste your money on this rip off\n",
      "That's the only way I can rationally explain why these EarPods have such a high star rating.  I used the old iPhone earbuds until they fell apart pretty quickly (of course), and as far as usability, I was satisfied if not happy.  These new EarPods are spectacularly bad.  They don't sit in my ears.  If I turn my head even in the slightest, the earpods wiggle and fall out.  When I use the earpods to call someone, I have to hold my neck perfectly still and rigid if I don't want the earpods to fall out.\n",
      "Ordered these about 4 months ago. Seemed to work fine for first few weeks then the volume keys started to not always respond to pressure. Now they only sometimes do and I cannot select playlists at all. I only used them 1-2 times a week for commuting on the train to/from work, then stored them in the container they came in when not in use. I am now overseas without access to other options. Not satisfied at all, I thought this was supposed to be a high quality product.\n",
      "when they came, they had someone's ear wax on them. also, the wire was showing. bad quality dont buy it\n",
      "This is false advertising. Shouldn't this be illegal? Definitely not apple product. Amazon shouldn't carry this product- it's not what it's advertised to be. All that wait for a knock off product. I want my money back\n",
      "But I really thought these were real. So far, I'm using it now and have to get used to the lack of quality.\n",
      "if you're looking for really good headphones with amazing sound quality, then stop searching because these are awesome!!!!!! 100% recommend.\n",
      "These earphones were so comfortable, but about 8 months into their life, the right earphone gave out (including the speaker, volume and skip buttons)\n",
      "The next day after using them for just 24 hrs the top left ear peace just split in two with wire falling out.\n",
      "It is SO obvious these are fake. Go to the Apple Store instead. Really. These do not give any bass whatsoever.\n",
      "These are FANTASTIC and you can't beat the price.  Unfortunately, Apple no longer makes them and they are getting hard to find online.  I know this because not long after I bought these on Amazon, I stupidly left them in a pants pocket that went through the laundry, and now they are more or less broken.  I returned to Amazon to buy another set and... no luck.  It's my own fault!\n",
      "I bought these because I wanted to replace my headphones for the iPhone 4. I use the microphone feature a lot, so I wanted to get Apple ones. Amazon had a lot of different options for what are the basic headphones, so I just decided to spend a little more. I am glad I did! I was instantly impressed when I first used them. They fit more securely than the regular Apple headphones did, and the bass was NOTICEABLY better. They do not seem amazingly durable, but as long as they last a while they are worth the money.\n",
      "I love the new headphones from apple.  I even use these to work out with, they stay put, and love the vol control on the cord.\n",
      "It is the original apple new ear pods, 100% way better than old earphones, fit better my ears and sounds is even smoother but powerful\n",
      "I had these ear buds for about 2 months, and then the left side stopped working. I tried wriggling the jack around in the port, but it didn't work. Luckily the mic and right ear still work, so I am able to use it for talking on the phone in the car. But as for being able to listen to music in both ears, that is out of the question. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!\n",
      "If you are still searching for the perfect pair of buds, look no more. Donning these quality headphones you can be assured, and reassured, that compromise is a thing of the past. The excellent ergonomics and full sound make for a truly unrivaled experience. Plus, what can you not appreciate about the iconic style? Give them a try. I guarantee you'll like 'em!\n",
      "These EarPods sound great and seem to hold up quite a bit better than the buds that came with my iPhone.\n",
      "The apple earpods speak for themself and are the best earpods for the I phone 5. Continuously a great product.\n",
      "This product overall it is good and better then most. I like it! Last pair I had one of the ear plugs sound failed so I had to replace it for new one pair\n",
      "this was advertised (as the title above states) as apple earpods w/ remote and mic.  what was delivered were just earbuds.  no remote and no mic!\n",
      "I'm just amazed on how good they sound for almost $10 it was worth it. i might buy another pair(:\n",
      "I love being able to walk with these.  Volume control is easy from the cord, and also for answering the phone without reaching into my pocket for my phone.  The music picks up where it stops after a call.  EarPods are comfortable.  I couldn't imagine not having these for my walks now.\n",
      "I love these headphone they fit just right in my ear the only problem it my headphones didn't last long\n",
      "i love the sound of this earphone! the earpods looks original. so i hope it so.! hehe~  and hope it wont brokes easily!\n",
      "They kept falling out of my ears, not a good fit at all. The sound was great, when I could keep the headphones on. Also, the cord is way too short for me. I find that everytime I move my head, the cord is not long enough and the headphones fall out of my ear. The cord is only about 4 feet, but most headphones that I've used and enjoyed have about a 4.5 foot length. I am 6'2\", so I prefer having about 4.5 feet of cord length.\n",
      "Previous apple earphone was horrible and was just to satisfy the out of the box moment when you purchased iphones and ipods. But this one truely deserves recommendation to be purchased for any of the devices you own. Good comfort. Though some people do complain that it doesnt hold up well in their ears to me its perfect. Though not the ideal one for going for a run. Every time i run it gets little loose and annoying. Though it doesn't come off.\n",
      "Sound quality really isn't all that great. Apple knock offs perhaps? Probably should have just sprung for the real deal.\n",
      "I highly recommend you buy these headphones, they have great sound, and it's awesome being able to pause and turn up and down the volume just on the headset. Definetly buy this!\n",
      "Honestly , these are the best earbuds I have ever owned. I have a closet full of several models to prove it. These are comfortable and do not constantly fall out of my ear or get sweaty in my ear.\n",
      "never arrived--I would have loved to give these a good review (and to be listening to music through them right now.\n",
      "At first I was skeptical that these wouldn't be the real ones, based on what I've seen but I'm here to say that these are the real thing and the best earphones I've ever had. The bass and intricate sounds that I never heard before on songs I can actually hear using these earpods. Believe me, this isn't hype. I'm one to tell it like it is and I don't review things unless it's great. Apple did a great job making these, I'm impressed.\n",
      "This earpods are a lot better that a was expecting, if i knew probably will have bought two instead of one.\n",
      "bought these for my son, he loves them, does not complain so i know they work fine. Price was not bad either which is a double plus.\n",
      "The sounds are wonderful. Better than other headphones I've gotten before. Annnnnnnd I tend to wear and break my headphones within the first 2-3 weeks of getting it. But with these headphones, I haven't had that problem at all and I've had them for a month and they're still good as new :D\n",
      "The sound quality of these headphones is great. There is really nothing I don't like about these headphones. I recommend these to any teen who loves listening to music.\n",
      "Amazing price amazing product.\n",
      "These are the best earbuds I've ever listened to. They literally compare to some $200 sony over-the-ears that I tested out in the mall one time.\n",
      "due to either configuration of buds or my ear canal they constantly fall out...will go back to flexible bud headphones\n",
      "Knockoffs. Cheaply made and not the real thing.  Horrible sound quality and a bad attempt at imitating apple earpods. Yup\n",
      "These were very nice headphones, however the wiring started showing after a week. One of the earbuds went out soon after.\n",
      "They do sound better than the older ones when comparing the bass and trebble, but they are not as LOUD as the older ones.\n",
      "i purchased to use for the Samsung galaxy s3 but listening to music is fine but can't use the headphone to make a phone call. So weird\n",
      "I love the knew ear pod design.  I'm not sure these were apple but they worked great.  I wear all day and night and I have to replace them about every 3 or 4 months.  With most earbuds I only get a week or two of wear.\n",
      "I've been fortunate (or cursed) enough to go through most of the major in-earphones, so I am not easily impressed these days. I tend to go through them rather quickly, for some reason, although, while I don't pamper them, I do take of them. The sound of this latest Apple in-earphone model did impress, particularly when set in stark contrast with its predecessor (which were HORRIBLE). The problem, as with most these days, is durability. I can't remember when I've had a pair that lasted a full year, let alone a couple. Most of the earphones I've purchased (Klipsch, V-moda, Bose, House of Marley, Ultimate Ear, etc.) were of the $100 variety, so WHEN they lose a channel or fidelity, I demand a replacement or refund. Unfortunately, although these weren't as costly, they were no exception. I've gone through two pair in six months, both losing volume in the right driver. Getting a full year out of a pair seems unobtainable. So, if you can afford $30 every several months, maybe these are for you. Otherwise, keep looking.\n",
      "I use these for biking. They are simply amazing for my purpose. Apple Ear Pods allows me to hear around me while listening to music. So dont get ran over by a car. Just letting you know that if your friends have the new ear pods. An for some reason they cant hear you. They are really ignoring you...\n",
      "If these are the ones that cost close to $30, They are the real deal. Bought something for $6.98 that sounded like something was plugging up the speakers.\n",
      "These are a replacement set of iPhone 5 headphones for a pair of older ones that died.  They work great, the microphone is very good.  I don't think they fit into my ears as well as most aftermarket headphones, but the sound quality is sufficient.  The button functionality is superior to most aftermarkets because they are designed by Apple to work with Apple products.  Having volume control and being able to skip songs is great.\n",
      "I purchased these apple ear pods after a friend warned me of fakes. These are the real deals. I found my lost ones and compared them to these and they passed. Didn't pay the regular price at the apple store. So happy I saved a weeks worth of cheap lunches at subway\n",
      "I like these earpods cause they stay in my ear, but, you have to put them in properly. Wish they came in black, or a dark color.\n",
      "It didn't even last me two weeks. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone especially if you like to listen to loud music like me.\n",
      "original original Earpods happy with it, recommended to anybody who broke his own ear piece  !Earpods happy with it !\n",
      "i bought this item pretty good price just wanna buy another its starting to have problems like one ear isnt workiing properly\n",
      "Not really a fan of Apple products but I get these because they are probably the best sounding best fitting buds for the price you'll find anywhere. Major upgrade from the old ones.\n",
      "I bought these because I had just got a used iPod and needed some apple brand earphones to fit into the hole in the case I bought for it. Really I wanted the older earbuds, like the ones that came with my iPhone 4S that I no longer own. These are different. When I wear them for long periods of time they make my ears sore. I can wear them with one in the ear and the other hanging down with the volume half way up and I don't disturb my classmates. I'm not really fond of the remote, I didn't really like where it was located at first, but I got used to it. The earbuds do their job. I really liked the case they came in, I use it to store them in my bag.\n",
      "I can not fault the desenpeño excellent product and great prices I find here .... I will buy another because I had lost my fascination and this 'll buy\n",
      "the sound quality is amazing, i use them everyday and i paid Half or retail price. A+ i love the apple earpods\n",
      "The sound quality and fit into the ear canal are superb.  For the cost I highly recommend purchasing these earpods. You will not be disappointed.\n",
      "cheaply made don't work. sound quality is very bad buttons for the sound don't work. don't waste your money even if it is 10 dollars\n",
      "These headphones have incredible bass, are well suited to the ear and the sound is perfect. I am very happy with this purchase.\n",
      "Doesn't work. Mic malfunction can not  hear and sound is distorted. Will buy at cell store from now on.  Poor quality would not buy again. Very disappointed. I\n",
      "My son (my go to source for anything electronic) recommended these ear-pods and they are excellent sounding, easy to use.\n",
      "i love it. it works well. it is brand new. i am using it every single day for music and movie\n",
      "I was nervous they would be rip of but product is apple made, the sound is great, and everything works\n",
      "They  brock at First of day of used !!and i dont recomend to somebody to buy this way but i can tray some diferent thank\n",
      "Excellent design and works great! Love the look of the bugs and as expected the audio quality is great too.\n",
      "I am not comfortable with the way they just 'sit' in my ear. In an effort get my twenty word minimum for this product I would like to say they sounded good but not good enough to warrant the stress of worry about them constantly falling out of my ears. Even though they never did. I only used them twice, and would sell them in a second. I've considered just leaving them in the break room at work but I'm too anal!\n",
      "I bought these thinking I was getting a great deal, but mindful of reviewers who suspected counterfeits either on this product or similar products.  They arrived from Australia, eventually. I used them for about a month.  Much as I tried, I could not convince myself that they sounded anywhere near as good as the Apple earpods I had lost and which I knew to be genuine.\n",
      "Gave them to our grandson for Christmas.  He use them for a very short time and they broke.  For what they cost they should have lasted longer.\n",
      "Although the item arrived in a very timely fashion (yay, Prime!), I had had high hopes that BOTH earpods would work, but sadly the right earpod is silent. And I don't really have the time to re-package & return. So the upshot is that I'm out $20, but I learned my lesson and won't use that supplier again. In the future, I will just buy from the horse's mouth (to mix metaphors) which is Apple.\n",
      "These are not the apple earphones. Jaunt cheap nock off's. When you shake them you can hear the internals moving around and the sound is terible.\n",
      "I lost my original headphone, so I bought it. Though it can't support my Android device with the line volume control function , it works well on my iPhone4s and Macbook Pro. good product for Apple users, I recommend it\n",
      "I would have to say that the Earpods I have got worked good but the last month are so the left sie broke and came off and the right side is about come off and it still works great but just only the right ear yu can ear things so in all I would say I loved them\n",
      "These headphones were way better than my old ones. But they are not as good as people made them out to be.\n",
      "I have bought these before, 3 times actually.  I seem to always lose them or once they fell on the floor and exploded!  The fit is perfect for my ears, which is their main attraction to me.:)\n",
      "Really like these new earpods.  The sound is super clear, even better than my old iPhone original earpods prior generation. Great quality on both the earpods and the mic. I strongly recommend these.\n",
      "The right earbud did not work. Also, the microphone and volume buttons will not work unless you have an iPhone. Very disappointed as they are otherwise good headphones.\n",
      "These pods stay in your ears, and automatically cut off the music when you answer the phone.  Love them, authentic apple product.\n",
      "Great ear phones and are apple OEM. I don't really like the material that apple uses for the cord. Its too gripy and curls.\n",
      "I have a lot of trouble keeping my ear-buds. My son borrows them and I never see them again! I purchased these to replace the older style shipped with the iPhone 4 and was extremely impressed with the sound improvement and these fit my ear better. I think I'm on my fourth set and can say the consistency of the product is quite good ;-)\n",
      "The order was on time and I plan to look for this vendor in the future. I will recommend to other friend and family.\n",
      "The product that you adquiricon, with specifications was what came to me.\n",
      "An obvious short. One side in an out. Little to no volume. Also, I ordered and paid for two sets. Only received one.\n",
      "Maybe the bass is great and maybe my music sounds pretty good but after just 30 minutes of use I have giant, painful blisters in both of my ears when previously apple earphones caused me no pain. I've heard maybe it's just my ear shape but I have NEVER had such a bad problem with headphones. I've had some too big, some too small, but none that ever caused blisters that hurt with any light contact. I can't put any earphones in my ears now! I'm disappointed in apple. The clicker is awesome as usual and I really did want to support the team and try out the new weird looking earpods but I'm going to have to return them and find someone still stocking the old ones or switch brands. I would never recommend these to a friend unless they had the opportunity to try them out first.\n",
      "I still have these headphones, almost coming up on an year I believe! There is nothing bad I can say.\n",
      "I purchased these after the original earbuds that came with my iPod 4th generation quit working on one side, and then two other sets of earbuds that we had around the house also quit working. I figured it was time to invest in a good pair and I had an amazon gift card to spend anyway. I use these mostly when I'm running and when I'm cleaning around the house. The convenience of the volume control on the cord is just splendid. I don't have to dig my iPod out of the fanny pack  or my pocket when I want to skip a song or change the volume. They never fall out of my ears while running, and the sound is very good while still allowing me to hear ambient sounds. Overall, I find them to be very good and would recommend them.\n",
      "Works as described. New in box and delivery was on time. Original earpods for my wife's iPhone. She was thankful for me getting her new ones.\n",
      "After using them regularly for a few days, I noticed they began to lose volume and eventually the right one stopped working all together. The left one is now broken as well. These are terrible headphones and I would not buy them again.\n",
      "The most comfortable pair of ear buds I have ever owned.\n",
      "The old apple earphones are fine, but the ones I had did not have a \"Mic\" or connector to speak into for the iPhone.\n",
      "Very Disappointed.  I Guess You Get What You Pay For.  NOT APPLE brand. Only God Knows What Brand They Were.  Poor Quality,\n",
      "I was having the older pair of apple earphones which i always suspected had some problems. I am not a big fan of the in-ear earphones. However, decided to give the new earpods a try. I am blown away by the sound effects. While it may not be comparable to the high end earphones like Bose etc,  I would say it worth every cent of its cost... The Bass reproduction is decent.. Since I don't have a i-phone did not test its microphone. Listening to music on itouch with this earpod is a pleasure. :)\n",
      "you can hear so much better with the new apple earpods than other brands.  money well worth it.  only down side is the volume and pause button only works on apple products.  would be great if it worked on android devices as well.\n",
      "I purchased this because I lost the ones I had.. I love this earphones and I don't get confused anymore which side of my ear gets the speaker LOL\n",
      "I must say when I bought two(2) pairs (one for me and the other for my wife) of these earphones I had high expectations. I watched the presentation of this product by Apple and was excited to experience what could only be described as a typical Apple experience (awe and total pleasure). The sound was not as deep and full as I expected and after a few minutes of continued wearing, the earpods felt like they were not shaped to fit properly in my ears.\n",
      "Great headphones! Work very well- have had them for a while now. Definitely would recommend to anyone interested in buying apple headphones!!\n",
      "Lets start by me saying I have an undying hatred for Apple products. I find them over-priced. However their quality is second to none.\n",
      "I can't prove it-yet, but I a have some doubts that these are not made by apple. They look exactly like the ones apple makes. but they feel different and if you pay close attention, look different. There was no apple logo on the box, and the mic is terrible when speaking on the phone.\n",
      "This product has already broken in two different ways. The front piece of the clicker that adjusts volume fell off exposing wires, and the plastic covering the wire just below one of the ear plugs has started to recede, also exposing wire.\n",
      "The new EarPods are a little better than the previous ones.. but still start to feel uncomfortable after continuous usage (over half hour)..\n",
      "I have to say that the earphone is thick but the right side of the earphone, the thing inside came off a bit and when I listen to a song, you could hear something, and it makes it sounds like its about to break. But it was good. I have the iPhone 5 headphone and the sound was soft and everything is better then this one. I hope this last long.\n",
      "So far I am really loving these earphones. Love the remote to change the volume, skip a song, fast forward, rewind, etc... No one can deny that Apple makes some great products. The sound quality is better than I expected, they are comfortable, and do not fall out like the standard ear phones that came with my iPod Nano (5th generation). I feel like I have brand new iPod!\n",
      "So I got mine free with the iPhone. Like I am an average person who finds the default apple earbuds pretty decent. I don't really have a great taste for different types of noise that may be emitted by my headphones and I kinda like them.\n",
      "they sound great, fit good and the bass on these badboys is better than the previous version, very happy I got them\n",
      "Upon first use they sound very nice and sharp.\n",
      "Have had this product for 2 months and the right side ear bud doesn't work. Can't return because it is past the return date. Now have to go to an Apple store and see if they can help me.\n",
      "I received the EarPods a lot sooner than I expected after losing my own a few days prior. Upon opening the small package, I immediately noticed the casing they were securely in didn't have the apple logo on the back and upon further inspection of the headphones themselves, there's definitely a difference in quality compared to the real thing (the imitation headphones are stiff and the sound quality is not on par with the real thing).\n",
      "I had used the older style EarPods, until they started to fall apart. I didn't know what to expect from the pods with the new shape. I found out they not only fit better but the sound is greatly improved as well.\n",
      "i never go the gym without these earpods\n",
      "All was well until I realized that you have to twist and turn the plug until you can hear from both speakers, like its a shortage or something. The sound quality is great, very clear,  but I have complaints about bad sound from the mic and I usually have to take it off for phone calls. The best thing that kind of make this a great purchase is that it is bogo!!\n",
      "I just haven't had time to work on it.  The EarPods are very nice and have a good appearance with my Ipod and Ipad.\n",
      "I'm reviewing the ones that came with my brand new iPhone 5 (so they're genuine). I'm an audio enthusiast, and I've tried many headphones/earphones but I must say that I am surprised that they were able to get this much bass out of an earbud design (where it doesn't form a seal in your ear canal). The benefit of this is that it doesn't block as much background noise so that you can still hear your surroundings depending on how loud you have your music but the downside is that low/deep bass is pretty much absent. I greatly value bass, so this is unacceptable to me but for what they are (\"free\" item that comes with your phone), they're great.\n",
      "These look and feel like an Apple product but qualitatively they don't measure up.  These ear pods pick up a lot of auxiliary sounds which can be heard by the wearer and the other person on the line. For example , if the phone is in your pocket while speaking, the mic picks up all the rustling noises in your pocket which you and the other person will hear quite loudly.\n",
      "These are actually the only ear buds ill use they have great sound quality for a great price and they are comfortable.\n",
      "Very comfy in the ears and the sound is great, love that it has a remote and a mic so I can control the music\n",
      "These earpods are a step above the old oem earbuds. Look forward to booming bass and great high level tones that do not sound screeching. I have found that I don't have to turn the volume up any longer. Also the ease of use of having volume control right on the line is super great.\n",
      "I use it all the time, every time, with my laptop,and my ipod. To watch movies, or talk to my daughter in USA\n",
      "The sound comes through poorly and L & R are unbalanced.  In short, either these are damaged or are generic rip-offs\n",
      "These babies stay in me ears much better and the sound quality is decent, given the usual crappy headset that shipped in the past...\n",
      "I can easily tell it is fake. I just wasted my money on useless thing. I would never buy such crap again\n",
      "When I saw these headphones I was skeptical, but a friend let me try them out and I was convinced. I own a pair of Beats Solo HD (but they are just bulky to carry on me), and I also have both the Bose MIE2i mobile headset and old version of the Bose MIE headphones. Everything else is just too expensive to buy and have the cables start to crack.\n",
      "I got a pair of these recently when I accidentally destroyed my old Apple ear buds. The new model fits better and has better bass response. I think the sound reproduction is fairly flat within the range it supports, but I'm not totally sure.\n",
      "Of all the Apple things I have; these earbuds are the least like thing. They are NOT comfortable in MY ears--period. But they'll do in a pinch. So in all honesty I couldn't actually recommend them to anyone. Just being totally honest here----\n",
      "I bought these for my girlfriend and waited almost a month for it to be delivered to me.\n",
      "these are not the original ear pods don't waste your money these sound awful. No bass or anything on this.\n",
      "Controls don't really work with Android devices.\n",
      "Out of my small earphone collection (Monoprice 108320, Soundmagic e10, Vsonic GR06, JVC fxt90, old Apple earbuds, a cheap sub-10$ set, and the Earpods), all of which are under 100$, the apple Earpods remain my favorite.\n",
      "They aren't the best ear buds or headphones, but they're certainly no slouch either.  The sound quality is a substantial step up from the last iteration of the Apple iPhone ear buds (or EarPods), and I the new shape fits better in my ears.  That means that if I have them in for more than an hour or so my ears don't become so tender and sore.\n",
      "Love these. Music quality is very good. Volume isn't too high, but it's high enough. The mic works very well and I love the volume/pause-play control. My only problem is that they are kind of large in your ears. But other than that they are my favorite headphones so far definitely better than the previous apple headphones.\n",
      "Should not have the word\"Apple\" in it's description.  They are not an apple product and quality is poor. Sorry don't like them.\n",
      "These headphones are very comfortable. I really like the remote. It is very easy to turn up the volume and stop the music from it. I would recommend these to anyone.\n",
      "The best in your In-ear headphones you're ever going to get.  Excellent sound quality what can I say apple Make their products good.\n",
      "First off they arrived way earlier then they were supposed too so I was very happy for that but when I tried them out on my iPhone 4 the sound didnt seem any different then before which was very low but guess what your in luck my phne is just messed up cuss they worked great on my boyfriends phone super loud and very comfortable will definently recommend these !\n",
      "I'm not positive these are actually authentic apple headphones. They frequently cut in and out whenever the cord moves slightly. Any small bump and the sound is only audible in one ear.\n",
      "I like them but at times they sound like there some generic apple headphones.They could be better.i wouldnt realy recommend because at a high volume the bass gets staticky\n",
      "My 13 year old purchased these and loves them. The sound is good, and she says they are very comfortable in her ears.\n",
      "The sound quality of these earbuds are on par with much more expensive brands. They fit comfortably in the ear and stay put even during a long workout.\n",
      "Clear crisp sound, ability to control iphone/ipod, great ear buds.  A bit costly but I think they are worth the extra few bucks.\n",
      "I like these ear buds, the music sound in quality is great. This is my 3rd pair, my cat chewed one and I lost the other.\n",
      "The product arrived as described, and appear to be genuine Apple EarPods. If you're looking for replacements, these are a good option.\n",
      "ive wanted an iphone since it came out. i didnt know that i'd be gettin a ROCKIN new headset as well. i guess i have two different size ears so other earbuds never seem to fit right. these not only fit perfect and comfortable, they also didnt fatigue my ear at ALL. i wore them at work for 8 hours straight! never in my life had i worn earphones that long without getting annnoyed. this design is truly innovative and i love these headphones. on my second pair cause i wore the first out. super comfy\n",
      "Way better than my old Apple Headphones, and honestly, much better than some of those ridiculously high priced systems out there at a fraction of the cost.  On airplanes, 2/3rds volume easily drowns out the sound of the engines, my old headphones couldn't come close at full.\n",
      "These headphones are nice. The volume doesn't work on them, but I contacted the seller, 321 shop (or something like that) and they replaced them easily and very courteously. I didn't even have to send the first pair back. As it turns out, the volume \"doesn't work\" on the second pair either, but someone told me it was because I was using them with a laptop, not a phone.\n",
      "It is a great product and the sound quality is great......besides it's apple product where can you go wrong right\n",
      "A nice pair of apple earpods.  A bit on the pricey side but nice fit, nice sound, and good quality.  Exactly what you would expect from an Apple product.\n",
      "Love this product, it arrived earlier then expected. The item description is exactly what I received. Couldn't be happier & will recommend Amazon to everyone I know!! Bought them for a gift & they were perfect!!\n",
      "I have purchased so many other earphones that just did not work for me. Even the one I received with the purchase of the iPod and iPhone do not come up to standard. These pods sits in my ear without irritating me. I loved them so much that when I was in Europe this summer I gave my set to my niece and immediately ordered one for myself and my son, who loved mine.\n",
      "i think that pound for pound, this product is a good value for the money.  I like them a lot\n",
      "I love the sound.  You save a few bucks buying it here instead of the store.  Only drawback is you really get to find out how much earwax you have.  The design of these headphones allow for great sound but also scoop up ear wax.  So you will have to clean them or your ears constantly.\n",
      "I got my earpods within two days. And they work great! They don't hurt my ears like other headphones. I use them all the time\n",
      "If you buy from rainbow tech beware because they are not real. Look real. But the sound isn't too great.\n",
      "These are the original apple earpods that come with the iPhone 5. Fit in my ears great and are pretty comfortable. So if you like the apple earpods I would recommend these.\n",
      "In the beginning the headphones worked well, but then after not using them for months one of the ear pieces stopped working.\n",
      "These are great. They fit my ears much better than 'normal' ear buds, sound is AWESOME and wish I had bought them sooner!\n",
      "The earbuds worked great the first month, but after that if the left side produced sound, the right side wouldn't. Be prepared to but another pair.\n",
      "Apple did great with the sound quality of these headphones. very comfortable fits to the ear well and great to wear at work for long hours\n",
      "I damaged my 1st one. I love this product because the buds fit very good in my ears. Good fit!\n",
      "I just received these Earpods today.  I wasn't expecting anything amazing.  Had some old Apple Earphones a year or two ago, and they were not this good.  These Earpods have some surprisingly good bass and It doesn't sound like the singer is echoing in my ear, which is a problem I have with my Skullcandy Skull Crushers.  I totally recommend these to anyone that need a good pair of Earpods, especially for the price.\n",
      "Received these on time but the right ear bud didn't even work, and when I set them down half the ear bud popped out and it looked like they both had split in half (sounds confusing but it's kind of hard to explain). The wiring felt very cheap and the ends of the wire that went into the ear bud itself would move around and it wasn't very sturdy. I ended up returning these and buying the actual Apple brand earbuds from a Radioshack. So my opinion, don't buy these headphones, you'd be better off spending $30 on them in a store.\n",
      "These headphones are a big upgrade to the original earbuds.  I really like having the built in microphone.  The shape is really comfortable, and can be worn for a long time.\n",
      "Product is exactly as described and nothing more. If you need some of these then this is a good buy.\n",
      "These are exactly what you expect from Apple; they are physically comfortable inside the ears, and they have reasonably good sound.\n",
      "The bass is really nice for apple earbuds, and they do fit comfortably in your year. Mine have lasted for a long time, so these earbuds are durable. I definitely recommend buying these\n",
      "the left ear bud stopped working within 3 weeks.i should have known it was too good to be true, JUNK\n",
      "Really good sound, looks and ergonomics, little pricier compared to other generic earpods but really worth it, once you have original equipment you can't go back to generic\n",
      "A world of difference from the headphones that originally came with my 4S (though those had admittedly grown worn out). Full, well-rounded, clear sound. These have transformed my listening experience on my iPhone.\n",
      "I'm not sure how long ago I purchased these but I think it has been months. I use them frequently and they work great. They have all the quality I expect out of a Apple product.\n",
      "These are better than the first version but need improvements. The buds themselves don't fit snugly into my ears so head movement causes the sticky cord to pull them out. The sound is better but If it wasn't so unfashionable I would wear my Koss Portapro's on my walks, how stupid am I?\n",
      "These are the best headphones so comfortable and easy to use. In line function is awesome too I recommend it\n",
      "Ordered the product and it came quickly, I just started using it, because I purchased a fake prior to buying this one and it doesn't work any longer (go figure!). Customers should do themselves the favor of thinking about the quality over quantity, it will save a ton of time.\n",
      "I quickly discarded a drawer full of earpods ( some of them twice the cost of the Apple EarPods). Great sound delivery and can wear all day long without discomfort. YUM YUM get one\n",
      "Has a nice loudness to it, not beats by dre loud, but good loudness for everyday use, train, bus, everything. It has nice bass to it, not too powerful, but very nice bass, these are way better than the ones that come with the galaxy phones, and is better than the in-ear apple earphones in my opinion, I wasted too much money on those worthless earphones... but these are very nice and recommend them to anyone who likes music and answering calls to use as a mic, even tho the mic could be better. Id be glad to ask any questions. Thank you!\n",
      "Bought these to listen to music on my droid razr maxx because of the fit and they are awesome! The mic doesn't work with my phone but its not an iPhone so I didn't expect it to. Would have rated 5 stars if I could use them to their full potential.\n",
      "Apple definitely has some of the best headphones I've ever had and these ones are no exception. I bought them to replace my old Apple headphones and I can't be happier.\n",
      "The ear pods are great, just what I expected. The are comfortable in the ears and work well for a hands free driving option.\n",
      "obvious improvement from the old one. and the siri button is convenient. for a non-music listener like me it is enough\n",
      "My earpods came in today the wait for tear thing took FOR EVER but for the quality it came in it was worth it. But then I realized the remote and mic didnt work and nothing is wrong with my iPhone 4S. But hopefully later on I will wear the earpods in and maybe the remote and mic will work OH WELL.\n",
      "Great quality head phones, a purchase I have never doubted. Bought new, so there wasn't much room for error but they are definitely recommended.\n",
      "This is really good and it's worth it the price is just awesome very low and very nice I love it ;)\n",
      "Thank you for the very good product. It is perfect and showed up in great condition! New as indicated. would order again.\n",
      "I ordered these so I could talk on my iphone while driving and the mic is faulty. At first, I thought I just always had bad service, but the problem only happens when I'm using the headphones. Bummer. I might as well have paid five dollars for a cheap pair.\n",
      "Happy to purchase this product. Kind of pricey but it's worth the money. Very cool upgrade from the previous iphone/ipod earphones. Very light in the ear. Doesn't hurt if you're using it for a long period of time. Good quality sound and BASS. surprisingly! perfect alternative for Beats. There's no noise canceling but if you're walking in the streets of NY, noise canceling is kind of dangerous, need to be alert all the time.\n",
      "comfortable, good fit and they sound pretty good.  I've had these now for a few months and they are far superior to the older style Apple earbuds.\n",
      "Really terrible, overpriced headphones. The audio is very poor and the headphones do not fit comfortably in my ears (they actually hurt my ears). Do not waste your money on these!\n",
      "This is a general review for these earphones. I got them with with my iphone 5. So no issues on fake or genuine. Seriously saying these are good in sound quality but not sturdy. These get tangled a LOT. The quality is not that good though. In 6 months the earphones have a weird white noise. Even if they are tightly fit in my iphone or my laptop or my computer they wont work as normal. What I am trying to say here is that, the Jack and wire going in the Jack tends to get loose. Its not because poor care or anything like that which some people might think. Let me tell you that I take utmost care of my stuff.\n",
      "I liked these when I got them with my iPhone 5.  I purchased these to replace the older ear buds I'v had for years.  These are really comfortable, dont fall out and have a pretty solid sound.  The remote works well even when I sweat on them (a problem I had with the older buds is, when the remote got wet, it would fast forward, pause, bring up Siri without touching the remote).  Got these to throw in the gym bag and I have a pair in the backpack.  The first pair still work great after a year of abuse.\n",
      "I bought these headphones as my other headphones got a short in the cord. They were the original headphones that came with the Ipod 4 and those were great. But these ones are even better. The bass is much better and I just love the convience of having control of the volume near your ear instead of reaching in your pocket to change the volume! Very impressed! Great Job Apple\n",
      "They aren't beats or anything but the sound quality is decent. In particular, songs with deep bass sound much better than they do with apple's older version of headphones.\n",
      "...and they still work! Amazing product, even by Apple's standards. I was hesitant to buy these because of my experience with the older generation headphones, but these are incredible. I washed them and put them in the dryer and they work perfectly, they just look a little warped. There's no substitute for these.\n",
      "Clearly Apple Earpods rarely fail. Value and quality with out compare. Most competition is  laging behind. Somehow someway amazon knocked a couple of bucks off the price to boot. Good luck and try finding the price else where. Onward Manzana!\n",
      "No doubt this earpod is the best when it comes to sounds and procedures that you have to follow there's nothing to worry about.\n",
      "Had gotten excited about these headphone but they don't fit in my ears. I ended up giving it to my mom, and she broke them in three days.\n",
      "They're working perfectly fine. Came in way earlier than I was expecting. Since it was coming from China, it said the wait was gonna be 3-4 weeks but it came withing like 4 days.\n",
      "It was in the retail box. I gave the earpods as a gift to my friend, she is happy with it.\n",
      "These ear pods are an improvement from the previous generation Apple ear pods, and I thought the others were good, before I washed them, that is.\n",
      "great quality as expected from Apple.  Better pricing on Amazon and instock too. My son's first pair got stolen at the gym and he had me reorder the same ones.\n",
      "False Advertising, I thoughts I was getting Apple Products. Not good quality, sounds muffled, and does not have good hi- or lows frequencies.\n",
      "I got these to replace my original iPhone 4 earbuds that was starting to fall apart. I wish I had gotten these a Long Time Ago! They are about as perfect as I could ask for and well worth the price. They stay in my ears much better the original apple earbuds (they have yet to fall out once), resist my sweat as I exercise, have great sound quality, and come with a great protective storage case to keep them in. Just be sure to note how they are packed in the storage case they come in Before you unpack them so you can put them back in it easily when you need to store them.\n",
      "I was really excited to get these headphones and i was somewhat disappointed when I used them for the first time on a run and kept having to adjust one of them. The fit isn't perfect and that is a real nuisance. On the other hand the sound from these little babies is great. The bass is clear and sounds amazing, however in the higher range it gets a little screechy . Other than the fit, I do like the way my music sounds coming out of these.\n",
      "These ear pods make music sound amazing, they really optimize the sound, the only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because they kind of hurt my ears if I wear them too long. I do have small ears so I can't fully blame the product. Other than that I enjoy them.\n",
      "Love the remote and mic. Although can be a bit of trouble depending on your ear size, if you know that they will fit in your ear then I highly recommend. Good Quality Sound.\n",
      "For listening to music, they do not replace the Apple item.  I purchased these as a replacement for the Apple EarPods. They lack the bass amplification of the Apple EarPods, but overall they are comfortable and a good set of general use ear buds for the price.  They are excellent for phone conversations and watching videos.  Sound is clear and consistent.\n",
      "Very impressive sound, very impressive price.  It even has hands free talking.  It has a lot of unexpected, really neat features for the talking function for the Iphone.\n",
      "These are great ear buds. They fixed all the previous problems such as the rubber around the part that goes in your ear, which would come off if you used them for exercising.  Sounds good and the mic works for hands free use of my iPhone.\n",
      "I hate the headphones that are rubber and go in your ears so this is perfect because I can still hear things going on around me.\n",
      "Great sounding earbuds, great bass response, with the same problem of most earbuds; they won't stay in.  This is frustrating every time you turn your head  and the opposite side fall out - minus one star for that.  They sound great though.\n",
      "I was so tired of purchasing cheap headphones that didn't last long. Although I didn't want to spend $30 on a pair of headphones, I'm so very glad I did. The sound quality and bass is amazing! MUST BUY!\n",
      "These are great. They fit in my ears and stay in perfectly. Sound is better than my old ones. Quality is great. Longer cord than my old ones. Speaker is great too. These are exactly what I needed.\n",
      "I love these head phones. They make a difference in the sound and the bass and treble are equal and sound great.\n",
      "The sound quality of the EarPods is excellent. The only reason I didn't give it a five-star rating is that they are still slightly too big for my ears. I'm not sure if everyone else's ears are bigger than mine and that's why all apple ear buds hurt my ears, but these are no exception. However, they are slightly better than the Apple ear buds that came with my iPod.\n",
      "It never lets me down. I have purchase two times already. I would recommend to others to buy. it wont let you down\n",
      "Apparently this thing works! Been walking around the busy streets of New York city and the people I call hear just fine!\n",
      "Simple, comfortable...  the cords get tangled easily, but are very sturdy.  I buy these for my employees all the time.  Love it.\n",
      "I've had to replace 2 pairs. The wiring in the jack goes for some reason. I love the buds, themselves, and customer service has been very helpful (from both Amazon & Apple). Keep in mind, that they carry a 1 year warranty from Apple, so keep your receipt and contact them if you have issues like I did.\n",
      "This designs works well.  The pods stay in my ear better than the old one.  It doesn't pop out as easily when walking or running.\n",
      "Yah it was way more than any other product... but it WORKS. I tried the inexpensive  imitation and they sucked.\n",
      "These headphones are the best - you can barely feel them and they stay in so well. I use them for everything from taking the bus to running on the treadmill to chatting with my mom. Love them!\n",
      "The title says it all...\n",
      "After my original Apple earpod broke, I got a few cheap earpods. They weren't worth the money I gave, even though they were around $5-10. I looked for an original Apple one on Amazon, was ready to pay more to get better quality.\n",
      "5 stars for being the legit Apple Earpods, worth paying for the quality rather than waste money on cheap imitations!\n",
      "I'm not happy with these earbuds because, although the sound is great, the remote and microphone stopped working after 2 months. I replaced my previous apple earbuds for the same reason, thinking that these new models would last longer. They only lasted 2 months before the remote/mic ceased to function.\n",
      "Ear pods are GREAT I like it much better when compared to other generic products it fits perfectly in my ear and very comforftable\n",
      "Great item with good price, i got it with a great condition and on time as i expected, i will order again from the same brand.\n",
      "Wow! The sound quality and breakthrough design is amazing. Most headphones fall out easily or hurt my ears due to the size of the earbuds, etc. However these are comfortable, sturdy enough to run with and have great sound quality!\n",
      "great product, did shipped on time and arrived perfectly am using this new earpods to replace my old ones (3 months old) that were damage too fast\n",
      "Review advertised used earpods, I figured they might be used or knockoffs or not work perfectly (problems with remote, etc) but these are great. Arrived packaged as new, they appear to be legit, and they have great sound quality and the remote works just fine. Plus, they got it to me super fast. So glad to be upgrading from the old apple ear phones with the rubber flaking off and hurting my ears.\n",
      "This is a great next step after the free ear buds that come with the Iphone. These came with my son's recentpurchase of his IPod Nan device.  I tried them and ordered this product for my IPhone 4.  Loveit.\n",
      "Maybe I misread the product description but I thought these were earpods designed to fit IN the ear, obviously they are not and are no better than the ones provided with the Apple Shuffle as far as comfort and staying in place.\n",
      "These are one of the best headphones ever. They fit perfectly, they have a good bass, good noise reduction, and are cheaper the real deal. Get them.\n",
      "I have really enjoyed using the EarPods. I am very active so I enjoy that it is small yet powerful. The remote and mic speak for themselves. One problem I did find is that if I tried to use them while vacuuming my ears would get shocked. I called in and this is a known problem; however it only happened to me that in that one situation. I have never had a problem hearing even the quietest sounds. They are also very comfortable.\n",
      "Couple of Weeks ago I bought these headphones, volume adjustment was stopped work from day one itself.\n",
      "Apple products have never disappointed me. These earpods are beyond amazing, definitely recommend if you love to hear your music with high quality. Who doesn't?\n",
      "I like my EarPods. They allow me to listen to audiobooks and I call my family more often because I can use the Siri feature from my phone. Sometimes they fall from my ear. But I bought some Quirky Props to solve this problem.\n",
      "I happened to machine washed it. But this earpods remains in good condition after I dried it. 5 stars for durable Apple goods.\n",
      "these head phones blow. always fall out of my ears. I would not suggest buying them. I regret it. one more word\n",
      "I don't listen to music much through headphones, not because I don't like to, but because in-ear headphones have NEVER stayed in my ears. I've tried several brands over the years including Apple's own headphones packaged with their iPods starting in 2004 all the way until now. I've also tried brands like Skullcandy in several models, and other models that came with phones and or CD players. The results were all the same. No matter which size cushions I picked on them, they were still too large for my ears. They were always falling out, and I always ended up losing the little foam/plastic cushions.\n",
      "Really, not much to add from the other reviews, so I just want to say that this new design is much more comfortable than the old apple headphones. Someone said that they were a forgery, I don't think mine are. I compared them to the ones that came with the iPhone and they look the same and sound the same.. if they are, well, they fooled me!\n",
      "These headphones are great. I have very small ear canals and most earbuds do not fit in my ears. The old Apple headphones slipped out all the time. These are the best of both worlds, and the mic is much better as well.\n",
      "The Apple ear pods are great and work as advertised. What else can you say for them except that they stay in well.\n",
      "The sound. The fit. Nothing is better than this version of the popular headphones. If they were any more cool, they be made of ice...\n",
      "I like the ear pods but if you use them a lot the wires fail. I wear them at work and have gone through 3-4 sets due to internal wiring failure.\n",
      "I have two sets of the real earpods sold by Apple. These are absolute fakes . I would advise that no one purchase these if you are looking for a set of ear pods. They sound no where as good and I am sure they would probably fall apart if used very long. I would have rather given this person who calls them self Roger Lee on the return address than have them think they needed to scam me with a fake product. I suppose they think we are all stupid here in the States !  Amazon is making the mistake of mixing these fake sellers in with the honest sellers. Sadly the review for the product doesn't fall where it should. Just be careful folks, there are some fakes floating around. Like I said mine shipped from China. China is going to ruin their selling power on the net  . This is the second and last time I buy any product directly from China. Have been stung both times.\n",
      "apple's product is always best, but my phone is nexus 4, it can not control the volume. ....i like it\n",
      "I have heard the many people say that Apple inc. can sell anything, not matter what it is. Some even attribute the success of these Apple EarPods to that saying. Nevertheless, this product's success cannot only be credited to the Apple brand, for they are innovative and exceptional headphones.\n",
      "These are very good sound quality for earpods. But if you are comparing to over ear headphones then you'll probably want to go with those instead. But with stuff like this, ya get what you pay for.\n",
      "The headphones are very nice, but I wish they had not created so much packaging. More importantly, I wish the packaging was made from recyclable plastic.\n",
      "I received these earbuds when I bought the iPhone. Although the sounds is good, they are extremely uncomfortable and they hurt my years after 15 minutes of having them on. I can't believe Apple made such a bad product. I now need to buy new earbuds!\n",
      "My old apple headphones finally croaked so I bought these. They work exactly as I would like them to and sound great.\n",
      "Well, I bought these about 3 months ago and now after constant use, the wiring near the plug is starting to come loose.  Plus the Earpod just broke.  Also, the part that allows you to talk on the phone doesn't work either.  When people call, they can't hear me!! What a piece of junk!!\n",
      "The regular Apple earbuds (and most others) don't stay in my ears.  These sound terrific and stay put, even when exercising.  They are pricey, but my last pair of Phillips earbuds, which were similar, lasted almost 10 yrs before I lost one of the cushions on an airplane, so I think they'll be well worth the investment.\n",
      "seemed fake, broke first day.  no more than 5 minutes of use and one broke, sounded like s*** too, sucks.\n",
      "I have used the classic headphones for the past 5+ years and the most annoying part is the rubber around the edge wearing off and then not being able to use them anymore. With this new design you will not have that problem.\n",
      "The microphone doesn't work with my iPhone 5. The rest of it works, so I'm going to use them as a backup pair, even though the sound quality is also subpar. There are a lot of better deals on here, and I wouldn't recommend these to another person thinking about purchasing a pair.\n",
      "Disappointed. I got my apple earpods a week ago and it's obviously fake. Material is cheap, and I feel something in the earbuds moving around making a small rattling sound. I used the earpods to talk to my friend and they all said they're having a hard time hearing me. I had a friend call me with these earpods just to hear what they were talking about, and my goodness, a cricket could chirp louder than that.\n",
      "I ordered these headphones thinking that they would be genuine apple headphones as stated in the description and I was absolutely wrong.. Everything about these headphones were false. They came packaged in a knockoff apple box and were are faulty as the packaging. Within seconds of untangling them the piece on the microphone fell off also, the \"buttons\" that control the volume also did not work. TOTAL SCAM. Learn from my mistake and DO NOT waste your money!\n",
      "The EarPods that came with my iPhone are really great, but the pair that I bought online were refurbished or something and talking through the microphone was terribly muffled/impossible to understand...\n",
      "Best earphones for this price on the market !\n",
      "headphones with very good sound quality with a low price for the quality that they are obviously Apple\n",
      "I refuse to wear any pair of other headphones. They seem to fit my ear perfect without being uncomfortable or falling out.\n",
      "This set replaced my original ones that I got with the Iphone 5. I missed them so much that I had to replace them.\n",
      "Paid $30 for these and hoped for awesomeness but didn't get that much noticeable sound improvement.  Definitely better bass but I think you have to crank it up to appreciate it.\n",
      "delivery was on time - product was exactly as promised - in original box and sealed\n",
      "Headphones broke inlets than a week. Cheap imitation. They did work for awhile then they started to fall apart shortly after.\n",
      "I bought these refurbished from \"Store D\" for $13.99 with shipping. They look and feel brand new. They were even packed in original apple packaging. The headphones themselves fit my ears perfectly and like any apple product they look beautiful. They have way better sound quality than the last generation apple headphones and are louder at the the same volume.\n",
      "Sound quality is horrible along with quality in general. They didn't do half a bad job of replicating the look of the real Apple headphones, but they are obviously fake by several easily notice things before even using. DON'T BUY!! Just she'll out another $10 or so and get the real thing. They are SO much better, I've had a pair for awhile that are starting to break from overuse (lots of running, falling asleep in them, and just constant use in general), but they are my favorite headphones I've ever used!\n",
      "Great sound quality..as Apple creates great stuff. The outer shell for the new headphone type works well for the clumsy..I approve!\n",
      "In the beginning I thought it wouldn't fit well in the ear, but it is really nice. I bought it to listen music during bike riding. It is perfect! And easy to forward music or answer the phone! Let's see if it is really sweat proof!\n",
      "These are clearly not real apple products.  They stopped working within a few days.  As they were a gift, I was embarrassed to find out they were not working.  Apple products that are original would most likely never have broken that soon.  I even missed the return deadline and had to go ahead and by a replacement from Radio Shack.  I bought them fromAmazon because it says they were Apple EarPods.\n",
      "It's worth a buy... Great sound and everything.. Love love love love it.. But yea, I would purchase it again if I had to\n",
      "Apple products always deliver. Although you're paying more you know what you're getting. I always recommend Apple Products cause of reliability\n",
      "its a good for the price for it is. volume controls don't work for non apple phones, sound quality is okay\n",
      "In my opinion this is a great ear piece. Weaker than any Monster headphones but still more comfortable with great sound quality. You can leave it on for hours and not fell anything (so I would prefer these headphones than those overprice studio headphones, which I have collecting dusts in my closet). The bass is great, its not overwhelming as most people have said already. Sound is crisp and sharp. I will be listening to KOL all day because thats how good they sound on these earphones.\n",
      "After putting these in my ears, I started to hear voices: soft and beautiful. At first they said stuff that wasn't relevant to my life, but after a couple of days I heard words of encouragement about my career and sexual relationships.\n",
      "Bought this for a friend; although the sound quality is ok - they keep falling out of his ears.  Very irritating!\n",
      "The title says it all. These are very comfortable and have the best sound that Apple has come up with. Having a set of controls is a real plus since one doesn't have to fish for the unit when you wish to adjust the volume or pause the play.\n",
      "Great sound quality, but sometimes the buds can be a bit uncomfortable due to the hardness of them. But, I would still recommend them!\n",
      "These are bad...like really bad. I ordered two and one of them stopped working in a day. The other one barely works and the build and audio quality are terrible. Never buying this product again.\n",
      "Apple has a video on their website describing the new \"Earpod's\" headphones that I believe now come standard with the iPhone, this video was what sold me on the new Re-design of Apple's classic trendy white headphones that you see in commercials and everywhere on the streets, subways and on busses. That video describes the way that Johnny Ive and his team assembled and redesigned these new headphones to fit any ear and sound much better. see the video here: [...]\n",
      "These headphones are very good quality and they really surprised me. The bass is really good. The button has been improved from the previous model of these headphones.\n",
      "I'm liking these very much, because they're very sleek, sound pretty good, and last but not least, don't fall out often\n",
      "Had them for 1 week and broke didn't expect that at all very disappointed In the quality of the earphones\n",
      "I know these are cheap, but bad quality..... the sound is not as the original Iphone earsets. I am returning them.\n",
      "These headphones stopped working within a month of purchasing them.  They were fine at the beginning, but clearly aren't built to last.  I'm fed up with Apple at this point.\n",
      "my wife said that she thought the ear phones supposed to all hurt and uncomfortable. but she thinks these are different. these are great and much more comfortable than the earlier type from iphone.\n",
      "I have always had a difficult time finding ear buds that will fit in my ears.  These are great and the sound is amazing.  Highly recommend these.\n",
      "These are worth the price and hold up well. My husband is hard on head phones and these hold up the best.\n",
      "Just apple style, expensive but of good quality.\n",
      "I like these earpods much better than the original iPhone/iPod earpods.  The sit in the ear much better and the microphone works great, too!\n",
      "Do they live up to apple's hype? No.  Are they much, much better than the old white ear buds that came standard with apple products? Yes.\n",
      "Honestly, these are not too good. I've always had the same problems with Apple Earphones, they ALWAYS slip out of your ear. Eh, maybe I have a slippery ear, but these are Earphones. You need them in your ears to listen to them! Sound quality is alright for a pair of Apple Earphones.\n",
      "these ear buds sound fantastic and I love that they beefed up the clicker on the cord - much easier to use than earlier versions.  well worth the price.  stay in while running and sound quality does not suffer when wet with sweat.\n",
      "I got this as a replacement for my daughter. She lost her original earpods. So I bought a new pair. They work great. But she found her original pair. So now she has a back-up pair.\n",
      "Headphones worked amazing and the remote really came in handy when I went running. I really hate that I stepped on them a week after I got them and one no longer works.\n",
      "These are not very noise isolating as I work in a loud environment and need the rubber tipped ear buds.\n",
      "I got these headphones with my iphone 5. I couldn't wait to try them since Apple spent so much time developing them. I put them in, and the fit nice and are comfortable. They feel like they just sit in my ears and are going to fall out, but they don't. What I love the most is the sound quality. They have great sound and an awesome amount of bass. I can usually never find headphones that really excentuate the bass, but these ones do. The only thing I wish is that they cancelled out background noise. I like to listen to music when I mow, but I really can't use these because they don't block out background noise very well.\n",
      "I received the earphones thinking the mic would work but they don't so if your thinking about buying this don't\n",
      "Love it, good fit, good sound, clean. Definitely lives up to my expectations as with all my other apple products\n",
      "This is a good looking ipod headphone. Its marginally better than the previous regular design.\n",
      "This is what I ordered and what the seller stated, I received. These came in impecable, original Apple case and wrapper. They were brand new, indeed, and cheaper than the ones sold at Apple. The sound is decent and what's best, I don't feel like my ears hurt whether I am listening to them out in the park or late at night at home. Great to make phone calls. Sound is clear and you can control the volume up and down, you can hang up using the button too and even play your music, without having to use the phone or iPod, etc.\n",
      "Got it on time, but these are clearly not Apple quality headphones. They also started falling apart after a couple weeks (I've had to superglue them back together.) I bought them cheap, but as far as I'm concerned these are cheap headphones in Apple packaging.\n",
      "Zero stars.\n",
      "Wasn't even aware that earpods existed until the older-style earbuds on my iPhone 4S died and I asked the wife if I could have the unused buds from her iPhone 5. Lo and behold, they weren't buds at all! I was suspicious of the new design at first, but after several uses while walking/hiking, I'm definitely sold. The pods sound great and aren't too obtrusive in the ear. And the remote/mic on the cord has been improved - much better tactile volume control, IMO. Very satisfied customer.\n",
      "No problems, Everything about them is good! Works amazingly, mic is good quality, and I've had it longer than any other and they still work!\n",
      "The left and right pods aren't at the same level, also the mic doesn't work at all. It is just devastating to spend some good money on this horribly made product.\n",
      "Fit in my ear very well and the remote is so helpful when I'm running to skip songs or answer calls. I would recommend to a friend!\n",
      "The headphones aren't new technology it's just a new design which does help them fit easier but the hard plastic made my ears sore after a while. Sound quality is better than average for the price. I ordered a pair and when they arrived the cable was slightly damaged and the left earbud broke I contacted the seller and they sent me a new pair which seems better built without having to return the old pair.\n",
      "These are awesome!!!!  The best ear pods/buds so far that I have used, and I have 3 different sets and I thought each one was good.  But these are the best.  Spend the extra money for quality that does not hurt your ears and get great quality sound.\n",
      "sits very comfortable in your ears, sounds great and has good bass, i would recommend them to anyone, its a good deal for 25$\n",
      "it works fine and sounds good i shall expect more headphones coming from them i would recommend them to people\n",
      "They fit my ears spectacularly.  Even when I run they don't feel like they'll fall out.  The sound is just fine.  For Apple devices the remote controls are great.  You can skip tracks, FFW, RWD, Answer calls, volume etc.\n",
      "I was so excited when I ordered this product and did some research first. I was greatly disappointed when it arrived. It looks and feels cheap and the sound isn't all its cracked up to be either.\n",
      "I bought this mainly for the mic and remote, so I can use with my phone. However wearing this for more than 30 minutes causes severe pain.\n",
      "Really good quality, long lasting, and extremly confortable for the price range. They work for other types of phones too.\n",
      "I bought these EarPods after someone complained they could hear my music when I used the standard iPhone issued headphones.  Initially I thought the sound quality was better and they seem to sit inside my ear canal snugly.  But that was when I was sitting still.  Once put into real world situations (walking to work, sitting on the bus, exercising, etc.), they were terrible.  They were constantly falling out of my ear because the surface is smooth plastic, and once they fell out and were barely hanging on, it didn't matter how good the sound quality is.  The problem is the EarPods only have one fit.  There is nothing that helps it adjust to smaller or bigger ear canals.  And for the price, they aren't exactly disposable.\n",
      "They are very usefull. While running they won't get out of your ear and the remote is more likely to obey you. Very good product!\n",
      "I want so much to love these EarPods, which are actually my second pair of Apple EarPods....and I dislike them as much as I did the first pair (the older style).\n",
      "Reasonably priced. Works great. May have to\n",
      "I purchased these earpods used for about 5 dollars.  They came a day early in a small plastic case.  I was not convinced the new pod shape was going to be more comfortable than the Samsung S3 headphones I purchased a month earlier, but I was wrong. I can wear these in my ear for hours without noticing any pain.  There was not anything exceptional with the sound quality.  I liked the deep bass and sound of my S3's better, but the earpods have the best durability and make-quality of any earbuds. If your earbuds keep breaking, these are for you.\n",
      "These pods are very comfortable, and they appear better designed that the previous models, the sound is very clear, good [roduct, I am very satisfy.\n",
      "I think this are fake because I compared it with my iPhone 5 earpods, this fake ones have an insignia in the cord that says \"Designed by Apple in California assembled in China\" and the real ones doesnt have anything.\n",
      "These earpods work well with my android phone, good quality, great price. I would recommend them to anyone looking for new earpods.\n",
      "Good seller would recommend.\n",
      "The Apple Ear Pods work great. I have used them constantly since getting them about a month ago and I love them as much now as I did when I got them.\n",
      "Tried to go the cheap-o route with an off brand.  They only lasted a few months.  These are the new generation earpods and much more comfortable than the iPhone 4's.  They also work much better on a run or workout.\n",
      "1. Arrived very quickly\n",
      "At first, when I saw these earbuds, I was very sceptical about their sound. Turned out to be okay though. The sound obviously lacks some basses, but for earbuds, it could be way worse.\n",
      "I didn't know about Apples redesigned EarPods. When I saw them in my iPhone 5 box I was pleasantly surprised. I really liked the new shape and sound. Unfortunately after about 6 weeks of using them (pretty consistently) after work, the left pods sound quality reduced, it sounds as if there is something between the speaker and my ear.\n",
      "Just amazing sound quality is amazing fit well in my ears\n",
      "I was very excited to receive these.\n",
      "I broke my original pair that came with my iPhone 5 and was able to replace them very easily. Great pricing and a great product.\n",
      "Audio for these is fine, not stellar.  What's worse is they last only a couple of months before they become intermittent and finally die.  There are plenty of other better sounding headphones that cost less and for the most part, last longer.  I suggest buying the cheapest headphone that sounds good and stick with those.  These aren't worth the money it cost if you have to continually replace them every few months.\n",
      "They fit and sound better than my much more expensive Monster and Sure pods... the easy choice from now on.\n",
      "These earpods are amazing. Their sound is crisp and clear. They also have a great bass, that's a plus. They fit in your ear perfectly. Amazing, worth every penny!\n",
      "I love these earphones. For once, I read the instruction manual, and the buttons work like a charm. These are very comfortable and do not fall out during rigorous activity, such as running. The cable is long enough to be comfortably work during a workout.\n",
      "I decided to buy new ones after my old ones broke and I must say that these are better then the old ones they are just amazing\n",
      "I needed new ones since my mom took mine and I always go with the read deal not any generic type\n",
      "Is exactly what you thought you ordered.  Don't go to Best Buy, just order these.  I wanted a second pair but didn't want to pay their prices~!\n",
      "I am pretty picky about earphones and have used quite a few over the years.  First off, these are a huge upgrade from the traditional apple earphones.  I actually like the design quite a lot and have been using them on walks and runs.  The sound is very average, even for a earbud in this price range.  Just for the sake of comparison, I have a pair of skullcandy earphones that were about $15 and the sound here is about the same.  I can't really say they are uncomfortable, but they always feel like they are going to fall out.  They haven't come out yet, but I just don't like that feeling.  Maybe it is something you can get used to.  I haven't used the microphone, but the remote works well so far.  As a free headphone with a new iPhone or iPod, these are a big upgrade, but still probably not worth the $25.  I would probably give them 4 stars at $15-18.\n",
      "Unlike other brands, Apple ear buds can take a beating and still keep on going.  Like my other Apple ear buds, these went through the washer and dryer, and they still work fine.  The cord gets curly though from the washer.\n",
      "Don't fit well. Keep on falling from my ear.\n",
      "I've used a lot of ear plugs but these are by far the greatest, I recommend them to all go.\n",
      "I was skeptical I could get apple cheap, but here it is and it arrived fast.  Apple earPods, you know it just doesn't sound as good as head phones.  I wonder why apple is trying to change the dialogue.  The ear phones are what I got, i love them\n",
      "everytime my apple headphones break or i lose them, i come on amazon and order these. i’ve been ordering them for a fee years now and this past week i needed some more and noticed that they were only $8.97, so i bought two. When i received them, the packaging did not have the apple logo on the back compared to real apple headphones, and when i tested them out, the sound was absolutely horrible, there is no basd at all. No wonder they only cost me $9, but im disappointed that i recieved fake ones this time around\n",
      "While I fully admit I've never owned a hugely expensive pair of headphones and therefore don't have that caliber of product to compare these to, I just can't say enough good things about them. They are: durable, inexpensive, sound great, seem to work forever, stay in my ears, and have even performed well in sweaty and sometimes slightly rainy workouts. Love these so much!\n",
      "These are by far the best earphones I have ever bought. I am a person with strange ears and I have never found a pair of earphones that actually fit and stayed in my ear. These, however, are completely different and comfortably sit in my ear without me ever having to push them back in. This resting inside of your ear also helps reduce pain if worn for many hours. They do not go deep into you ear, as they sit just behind the cartilage above your earlobe.\n",
      "I used to just own the regular apple headphones and every time I went to run or lay down with them on they would fall out. So i went on Amazon and bought about 10 pairs of in ear headphones. They all broke immediately. Then I saw the design of these headphones and bought them they were completely worth it.They always stay in your ears, they are perfectly designed. The bass is a little weak but overall the quality is great.\n",
      "I am not satisfied because the microphone and fast forward or change song toggle doesn't work on my HTC One android device when I try to take/make calls or fast forward to next song.\n",
      "too expensive but the real deal, stay away from the cheap imitations, not worth throwing away ya maneyyy yo know what i mean cuzzzz\n",
      "This is my second set, my first ones being purchased at the Apple store.  These are identical - the only thing wrong with them was the adjustment slide was broken, but that was no big deal.  For the difference in price it is a no brainer.  Will probably purchase more in future.\n",
      "These are not real apple earpods I own a real pair. You can tell by the speakers their a different color than the authentic ones. Also it feels cheap and the bass is not as strong.\n",
      "This was a great buy! They are well worth the price and the shipping was very fast!  I love the new design, they are much more comfortable to wear.\n",
      "If you listen to podcasts and light music, these are the earbuds for you. I own an iPhone and these perform well while running, working out and just plain working. I would not recommend these for the audiophile type. They are not the \"full range\" audio delivery system like the more expensive headphones, but you get what you pay for. They are just a solid set of headphones.\n",
      "I like it better than the older model mainly because you hear the bass frequencies way better. Overall volume is also more than the previous model.\n",
      "great earbuds, love them!!!  fit in ear great!\n",
      "For this price the EarPods are an absolute steal, even if you don't consider yourself an Applehead, buy these without any doubt.\n",
      "In short these are my observations:\n",
      "they work great and fit nicely in the ear! way worth it when you consider the price. Great deal overall\n",
      "I can not control the volume or switch songs with the ear pods.  I would like a full refund or a new set of ear pods please.\n",
      "I love it! It fits right in my ear and the quality of the sounds are so much better than the old earphones from apple.\n",
      "I can't stress enough just how good these headphones are. I was so against in-ear headphones due to all the other brands out there. NONE of them EVER fit right and because of this I have stayed away from them. BUT, these Apple Earpods are IMMACULATE!!!! They have WAY better sound than my $50 over ear headphones for half the price!!! The bass is just AMAZING! With these Earpods, the speaker sets into your ear a bit and this makes the bass rumble all through your head! I'm telling you right now that if you are buying these for you Iphone, YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED! These headphones are also a headset. If you are jamming out to music and your phone starts to ring, all you have to do is tap the middle of the volume adjuster on the headphones. Same to hang up. 1 tap pauses the music, 2 skips the song, and just hold it to activate Siri! Again, I cannot stress how much I researched these and MANY other headphones and ended up getting these. THIS GUY IS A 100% SATISFIED CUSTOMER!!!\n",
      "These Apple ear buds are a nice improvement over the previous model. They fit in the ear much better and stay put. The sound is also better.\n",
      "I do not consider myself to be someone that can identify small nuances in audio quality. So what I will say is the design of these ear 'pods' v the design of the older style ear 'buds' is so much better. They are so much more comfortable to wear for long periods of time. I never have an issue with these headphones falling out and my ears, and the improved noise cancelation is fantastic. I highly recommend them.\n",
      "In my opinion, the ear phones are very good. For everyday use, it works perfectly. I do have some high performance head phones which i use at home but you cant compare Oranges with Apples, so im happy with my purchase.\n",
      "Believe it or not, you cannot easy find a earphone for android but for iPhone this earpod. It enough. If you try to use on android, you cannot use mic.\n",
      "I brought these a little hesitant\n",
      "i received a set of fake earbuds. I know how good the new ones sound but then again since only paying under $5 i know  the price was too good to be legit.\n",
      "Authentic apple ear pods at a cheaper price than at retail stores. Sound quality is superb and I would never use a different brand for ear pods.\n",
      "These headphones are great!  The sound is nice & crisp clear.  They're definitely worth every penny of $25.00.  If you're looking to purchase basic headphones for phone conversations or listening to music from your Ipod or Mp3 these are a choice.\n",
      "After I lost my original earpods, I ordered these.  They are a perfect replacement pair. Pricy as expected, but they do the job.\n",
      "The sound quality of the apple earpods may or may no be better than an average set of heaphones, but they continuosuly fall out of my ears, especially when jogging, and sometimes when just walking to class. I would not reccommend them, even to an iphone user.\n",
      "Good...\n",
      "I really like these ear pods but the cords/wiring is easily damaged internally. I bought a different hard case for storage so I don't struggle with putting them away in the case they come with.\n",
      "These headphones do what they say the will. They fit perfectly in my ears and deliver impressive sound. The only thing is that if you plug it into an android phone during a call it makes a screeching noise because it does not know whether to be used as a mic or a headphone. Other than that, perfect.\n",
      "Superb sound quality, a must buy for audiophiles, packaging is also great. Works great with phones and IPOD, IPAD. Satisfied\n",
      "good product best buy so far works great with my i phone 5 and its a good price and got to me fast\n",
      "Ordered those for my son because he couldn't find them at the stores. It was exactly what he wanted and he has used them everyday\n",
      "Waaaaay better than the generic ones that come with the iPhone, but not quite as good as the adjustable ones that are three times the price. The generic ones kept falling out of my ears whilst running. Don't have that problem anymore with these guys.\n",
      "So how can you tell if they sound good if they don't stay in the ears? I finally got one jammed into my ear and it hurt to keep it there. Such a pity to expect a smooth hard plastic to remain in the ears.\n",
      "Simply it is awesome product. very best deal and very good quality. Simply Apple is always awesome. GOOD PRICE TOO\n",
      "I love them. Great quality sound, fit nicely in my ear, good length cord. I had a speaker go quiet but after a week it was back to normal not sure why it did that but they are my favorite pair of headphones, the center button even works with my Galaxy.\n",
      "This was terrible. My girlfriend ordered these for herself because she thought she lost hers but she found them. So she ended up leaving them in the package for later. when she did open them (past the 30 days) they didn't work correctly. So now she is stuck with $30 pieces of wire. its not even good enough for a paperweight. this is depressing.\n",
      "I like to say this is a excellent device for my iPhone. It has the best quality sound for any earphones. Also you have better noise cancellation than previous iPhone earphones, and it adjust perfectly to your ears. I love them.\n",
      "These did not work when I got them. I opened them up and they sounded nothing like the actually apple headphones. Buy it new not used.\n",
      "These headphones are great.  I will buy them again when these go.  I had the Dr. Dre earphones and they were real trash.  The sound was bad, SIRI kept interfering and I couldn't manage to turn SIRI off ...these headphones would just somehow cause SIRI to keep engaging so I couldn't even listen to my music.  The Apple Earpods work as they should and the sound is great!!!!\n",
      "Now everytime I use the earpods, the right earpod doesn't work and I have to sort of jiggle it in a way to get it to the right frequency. As if I'm using an old radio, trying to get to the right fm setting. They worked well for a week and then these problems started, and now the right earpod doesn't work at all. Decided to just use my old ipod headphones for the time being.\n",
      "I had the previous apple earbuds and find these to be much much more comfortable. The audio quality is what was expected, functional. Primary reason I went with these was for the remote/mic unit.\n",
      "These headphones are good enough regarding the price and name they have. The voice is OK. I am using them for my Nexus 4!\n",
      "Came in Apple case. Sound amazing. Great price, cheaper than the store for real apple headphones. Definitely would recommend this product.\n",
      "i like this earpods with remote anh mic my daughter love it's thankyou all and next time i wiil buy more for this produc\n",
      "The quality of this product was awful and completly useless. I shouldn't have buy this and I would recommend you to don't buy it either.\n",
      "The first set of headphones I received caused a bad connection so the company offered to send out another pair.  I received the replacements but the actual ear piece fell apart on the 2nd day.  I know they were not that expensive, I just thought I would at least be able to enjoy them for more than 2 days.\n",
      "These ear buds are fake and stopped working within a week. Sound quality was horrible when they did work. Request a refund!!!\n",
      "I have one week and they stop working, like they explode from inside. I don't know about other customers, but for me was a bad idea to get this. They don't work!\n",
      "With all of the headphone products out on the market today, buyers have so many options.  But there is really no question that Apple offers the best technology for the price.  These ear pods are so much more comfortable than traditional ear buds.  The sound quality is good, but do not expect Bose quality for the price.  And when you are on the go, the remote is clutch.  5 stars.\n",
      "Works great as expected.  Worth the additional $5 vs. the $20 Sony headphones w/ mic which I ended up returning due to terrible sound quality.\n",
      "These earpods sound great and fit wonderfully but should be cleaned regularly because they can easily slip out if they get a little greasy.  A quick swipe of an alcohol pad or handi-wipe should do the trick.  Do not cofuse these with the much lesser priced copies because the bass response is much different.  The quality of sound from this pair is significanlty better.\n",
      "my old iphone headphones are a joke compared to these -\n",
      "These fit my ears much better than the original apple ear plugs.  Those were terrible, and much more expensive to replace.  I don't understand why the price has gone down so much, but I'm happy it did.\n",
      "They are cheaply made. The first day i put them in my pocket was the day one of the headphones split into two pieces. I was able to put it back together but now i have to be careful.\n",
      "The only reason I am giving them a 1 star is because they don't fit my ears.  They fall out and there is no adjusting them with different tips.  The sound is good but if they don't stay in your ears you can't hear the sound.\n",
      "sound only came out of 1 speaker. Yes they offered to replace them, too much trouble for 10.00. Would not recommend\n",
      "The ear pods have great sound and the case is perfect for protecting them when they are not in use.\n",
      "This is a late review but that is due to my procrastination.  These Earpods turned out to be a total disappointment.  The sound quality was less than I expected when they were rec'd and sound quality has deteriorated since then.  They are not useable now as the sound quality is horrible.  I have always been a fan of Apple products as their designs and manufacturing standards have always been outstanding, in my opinion. This product fell well short in comparison.  In fact, I wonder if they are counterfeit.  In the future, my Apple purchases , of this type, will take place in Apple stores.\n",
      "I like the earpods shape fitting into the ears, however it needs some friction on the surface to keep it there...\n",
      "I just opened my new Iphone 5 and it includes these same headphones and they don't sound that great, not the worst but not could be better.  Probably made in china and are really worth like 2 dollars haha.\n",
      "This product is definitely not new, the box was poorly repackaged to resemble a new set of headphones. It's still a good pair though, no plans on returning it.\n",
      "When I bought this pair of headphones they came quicker than I expected them to. When I got them the microphone didn't work, so the company sent me a new pair that work wonderfully.\n",
      "Nice pods I use them all the time with my iPhone the controls work great highly recommend these for sound and function\n",
      "I'm so disappointed in these ear phones. They broke within 2 wks of using them. The first couple of days, they worked fine. A week later the actual ear buds came apart! I put them back together. I started noticing that anyone I would talk to while using the earphones,.... they could never hear me clearly AT ALL! Just the other day the mic came apart. Can't put that back together. I will never purchase from that particular company thru Amazon. Looking for their info NOW.... To let them know!  Wish me luck!\n",
      "they worked awesome! just like the one you get with your iphone! it comes in the exact case and everything!\n",
      "I have always been a fan of non-noise isolating earbuds and these are really really good. the bass is a little heavy, the highs do compensate for it .. the mids are lacking a bit though. and really good fit, doesn't fall out at all.\n",
      "They have good bass and I loved how they sound... I would recommend this to any one who needs new ear phones\n",
      "I hate it, I should have paid attention to the previous reviews. I doesn't stay put in your ears at all, they kept falling, and I to make things worst the volume now doesn't work. For future buyers please don't waste your money, not worth IT!!!!\n",
      "They work just fine but the left breaks open every time I tap it. It can be repaired though. For the price they're ok.\n",
      "I couldn't believe how much better my music sounded with these - way better than with the ear buds that came with my phone.\n",
      "I bought these without ever hearing the sound quality first. I am picky about the sound quality I receive  from my headsets, and these did not disappoint. They sound great, have much more bass than the previous version, and many of the competitors. They fit well in the ear, and do not fall out. Because they are an apple product, they cost more than they should, but it was money well spent.\n",
      "It was okey. They are very good to listen music with so yes i really dont know what to say more o:\n",
      "Pros:\n",
      "So being a teenager, I take my headphones everywhere. I have had these headphones for about a week now, and they have been fine, not the best and it shows because sometimes when I am playing music it makes it sound like it is coming from a distance. I also accidentally banged it against my desk while trying to untangle it, and the piece of the headphone that gives it that unique apple shape just fell out, but luckily, I was able to just snap it back on. They honestly aren't the greatest headphones, but are easy to back and carry around, so I do recommend buying them if you are on a budget, but if you can get the real deal, get it. You basically get what you paid for. You pay about 7 bucks, you get quality worth 7 bucks.\n",
      "I purchase these to use with my LG Android phone.  I often listen to audible books while I'm driving and always had trouble keeping earbuds in place.  I used a set of headphones for a while, but didn't like the bulk of them.  The Apple EarPods have a unique shape that keeps them in place, unlike the earbuds I've used in the past and have a wonderfully full range of sound which works great with both voice and music.  The remote mic and phone switch also work with my LG Android phone just as good as the OEM earbuds I had.  A terrific product for the money.\n",
      "The design is excellent and not causing any pain in the ears for longer usage. I would recommand this to others as well\n",
      "OK... these earbuds are from Apple (i.e. not a low-priced imitation brand) so, like all Apple products... they exceed expectations. For the money you probably cannot find better sounding or fitting accessories.\n",
      "Wonderful product. Well designed and has a great fit. Love that the packaging also serves as storage case when not in use.\n",
      "Nothing special. Sound quality is good for non in-ear or over the ear buds. Holds up to moderate abuse well. Stays in the ear under most everyday  situations.\n",
      "The sound quality of the apple earpods may or may no be better than an average set of heaphones, but they continuosuly fall out of my ears, especially when jogging, and sometimes when just walking to class. I would not reccommend them, even to an iphone user.\n",
      "These are great compared to the standard headset.  They are definitely better fitting in the ear, which delivers more sound due to less ambient noise.  I didn't notice the superior performance claimed by some other reviews, but they are a good value.\n",
      "I expected the sound quality of these earbuds to be a lot better with the new design.  The volume does not go up high like the older model.\n",
      "Great buy and as advertised. Oem product does what is is supposed to. Can't beat the original at its own game,\n",
      "I did not get apple earpods.Instead i got an iphone 5 charger.I do not own an iphone and i am not planning to get one.This is a rip off do not ever buy from this seller.EVER!\n",
      "Okay had these for a while now, and I must say in terms of sound quality they are just amazing. The bass matches with the ones I've used or rather better. I don't know about other headphones that are expensive so I can't compare with there quality. These would provide the best synergy with your apple device as they work so well together. Siri integrates so well with this and volume controls are awesome. The mic call quality is better than the ones I've used with before and people had no trouble with me talking on it even when outside with strong windy weather.\n",
      "They are perfect the stay in my ear, which is a plus I always had problems with the old kind.  The sound is great.\n",
      "Hubby loves them. Best earphones for sound quality and fit that he has ever owned. Highly recommend; especially at the low amazon price!\n",
      "The only thing I was worried about was that this might not be the real deal. As far as I can tell, it is. It replaces another pair I bought from the Apple store and misplaced and looks, feels, sounds spot on... so I believe it's genuine.  As for the form factor. Either it's going to work for you or not. It's different. Other earphones, including the expensive in-ear ones don't feel right to me, or they pop out. These sit in the ear and sound good and are comfortable enough for me to fall asleep with. Good stuff.\n",
      "I bought this itemmainly to listen to podcasts and music on a Samsung Galaxy S 2, and also for making phone calls when I don't have my Bluetooth headset with me.  The sound quality is very good, not boomy  bass and nice treble.  Phone calls are easy to understand (in a relatively quiet room) for the party on the other end.  But Apple, I thought your premier earbuds would be rubberized, not hard plastic.  So it fits well in my right ear, snug and no discomfort, but on the left ear, it starts to hurt after a few minutes.  Also, because of the hard plastic, there isn't a lot of nose isolation going on.  You can hear ambient sound around you quite easily.  Which may be what you are looking for, but i wanted to hear my music (and call ins) without turning up the volume all of the way on an airplane.  If it were soft rubber instead, it would be more comfy.  And possibly block out a little more sound.\n",
      "They work great and having the volume control makes running with my iPhone a lot easier to control. I also like the more tailored ear bud shape as they stay in better and hurt less than the typical Apple earbuds.\n",
      "I'd expect nothing less. Headphones came a little slowly, but other than that I now have a cheap, working pair to keep on the side for when mine break. Having a back-up makes things a little less worrisome. Headphones, mic, volume control, all work. Not a particular fan of this generation shape, but that's a personal preference not to reflect the product. Product itself works like a charm!\n",
      "great sound, definitely I would recommend this product\n",
      "just like the one comes with the iPhone5 box. it works perfectly and made me less using my beats headphone.\n",
      "These are the best apple ear buds ever. They have a more comfortable design, and are of a better quality\n",
      "These are by far the best headphones I've ever purchased!! I def recommend these to anyone that's interested in great sound and music, bc they def work amazing!! Kinda sounds like surround sound!! I love it!! Def a must have!!\n",
      "These ear buds had two stages with my interest.\n",
      "the headphones work for what  i paid for. im not a loud person so when i spoke using the mic i had to yell a little for the person could hear me. But the headphones area  good product\n",
      "Don't buy them they don't fit as they are described. They fall out of my ear just like other headphones do.\n",
      "I have smaller ears so it's difficult to find earphones that fit my ears.  These are shaped differently and fit well.  Takes a little bit to get used to the shape but I like them.  I only with the remote portion was a little bit lower but other than that these are great!\n",
      "These earpods are very comfortable and fit hard to fit ears.  The sound quality is awesome and they are very affordable.\n",
      "I am not a fan of ear buds in general and was surprised at the level of base, etc.these produce.  They are not like over-ear headphones in quality but offer pretty good sound for portability at a low price.\n",
      "The difference between this and my other headphone was that the audio quality was so much better. Even the Microphone quality was above average, maybe even higher.\n",
      "Garbage. Absolute garbage. They fell apart, (literally) a day after I took them out of their packaging and the sound quality wasn't that good even before they broke on me. I didn't pay much for them but I expected more. I could have boughten headphones at a dollar tree that would have lasted me longer and given me the same type of sound quality.\n",
      "Great sound from apple.  works fine in my ipod  but the controls do not work in my non apple phone,\n",
      "Love these earphones. So far they are the only ones that ever stay in my ears without falling out. The design is brilliant and I would recommend them 100%. Sound quality is great as well.\n",
      "I just received my Apple EarPods with Remote and Mic. And I really like it. I bought to use on both my iPhone 4 and my iPad 1st Generation. I would recommend it.\n",
      "I bought these thinking they were going to work great... NOT AT ALL! There's a reason they were so cheap, because they were either made cheap or just weren't a great pair. They cut in and out. They either aren't picked up by the phone or it's cord. My other buds work just fine, I think it's just these!\n",
      "Actually purchased these for use with a non-Apple product -- the Galaxy Note II from Samsung.  They have great sound quality and I've never had issues on phone calls with the other person hearing me.  Highly recommended.\n",
      "the EarPods, recommended for lovers of music, I really loved these headphones allow me to hear the music that I like without worry.\n",
      "I'm surprised by all the \"these are knock-offs\" reviews. Of course I can't know what other people are receiving when they order this product, but mine came in original Apple packaging, very slick, and they were awesome. Clear sound, comfortable to wear, so so so nice. I kept them in the little clear plastic caddy they came in, because it was so cool.\n",
      "I've had these earphones for a couple months now but didn't start using them until a week ago when my original Apple earphones gave out on me. When I first inserted them into my ears they were quite comfortable. But after twenty minutes or so of using them they started hurting my ears. I tried adjusting them to see if they would stop making my ears hurt but to no avail. After an hours worth of use my ears were throbbing. I had no issues with the original Apple earphones. Sure, the original Apple earphones used to fall out a lot, but that was the only thing. These earphones are supposed to be more comfortable than their predecessor. I don't know if my ears are shaped differently or what, but I much prefer the original Apple earphones to these. Maybe my ears simply have to get used to using them. Anyway, I'm going to give these earphones a little more time to see if they'll stop hurting me, and if they don't, then it looks like I'll be shopping for a different pare. Other than them hurting my ears, the sound is better.\n",
      "Although I feel like a lot of people hate on the Apple earbuds, I've always thought they were the best earbuds I've ever used.  I think these are even more comfortable than the older model, plus the sound out of them is better.  I'm about to go on a long flight, and I'm definitely bringing these as my primary pair of headphones and will update as to how they perform in such a noise rich environment.\n",
      "Bought these for my daughter.  They work great with iPhone 4S.  As far as the comfort, she stated she likes them better then the original earbuds from apple.  Sounds great also.\n",
      "First off, I'll say that the headphones were packaged well and shipped for free in two days, both just as expected.\n",
      "exactly what I expected, beautiful.  I gave it as a present and my friend totally love it. Thank you all.\n",
      "These are the best head phones I've had at this price.  Fit perfectly and they do not cause my ears to hurt or get tired like other older earbuds do.\n",
      "Still the best earbud I've heard at much lower cost than many other comparable on the market.  Apple does a lot of things very well.\n",
      "its been less than a week and already the head phone jack needs to be toyed with in my ipod in order to get sound to come out of both headphone, and it completely doesnt work now with my iphone. I honestly think the only way to get quality apple headphone is to go through apple.\n",
      "I bought these to use with my Roku 3.  Typical ear buds never stay in my ears, but the Apple design really works well.  Sound is okay, nothing breath taking\n",
      "Im a life long rocker and i beleve if its to lout your to old thiese blew while useing my apple ipod nano  in the first week of use\n",
      "These little guys only lasted a few weeks of daily use, and then just stopped working. I'm pretty disappointed, because I have had dollar store earbuds hold up longer than these.\n",
      "Gift for my Grandson. He loves them.\n",
      "Great sound can come from ear buds, without costing as much as a pair of shoes. They are reliable and sturdy.\n",
      "I was dying to get these iPods for some time, the local stores were constantly out of them including the local 3 Apple stores.  I decided to go ahead and buy them here and saved about $5.00 off the retail price.  That is where the good news ends...\n",
      "These earpods are great , Fit the ear and the music is good. Music and listening to audiobooks works great.\n",
      "I love these EarPods, they stay in your ear and are very comfortable. The sound quality is really good. I highly recommend these EarPods.\n",
      "They seem to fit my ears and are comfortable to wear.  The sound seems very clear and is great when I walk with them.\n",
      "I cannot do ear buds, I have no idea how some people can just jam them in their ear, but I believe my ears are made differently.  So I use ear pods and they go in.  But with these, they don't \"lock\" in your ear, so they can fall out if you are moving around. I do find it much easier to have a conversation in my office and just sit back and talk and not have to hold something, and then the music really sounds good when I need to blast my brain with some tunes.\n",
      "Apple makes a great set of earbuds.  They fit well in small ears. The sound quality is very good.  They stay in well during running and exercise.\n",
      "these are very good headphones, the sound clarity is excellent and fit very well to my ears as the use for a long time do not hurt the ears.\n",
      "Wonderful I have owned these before but the price was just right when I ordered these replacement earbuds! I am happy with my purchase\n",
      "Now these are Apple ear pods, the sound is clear, the music sounds amazing, the microphone works great too.  Would recommend these to everyone.\n",
      "These ear pods are the best Apple pods yet. They're comfortable and stay in the ears without popping out like the round version. Finally they got it right!\n",
      "These EarPods fit in my ear perfectly and deliver beautiful sound quality and an easy to use remote and mic\n",
      "Wow, wow wow! Amazing comfort, great sound, fantastic base!  Love these!  These little white buds are rocking my musical world.  And the mic is very good too, I asked my friends on the phone.  Impeccable product, congratulation Apple, this makes me feel like Steve Jobs is still around!  Ah yes, they also control skip song (even on Pandora!), rewind, fast forward, call waiting, volume up and down, pause.  Buy these, trash all your other buds. There will be 7 stars I would give that rating this product without hesitation.\n",
      "NO COMMENT I REALLY DON'T CARE FOR THE THESE EARPOD  SO I GAVE THEM TO MY DAUGHTER NOW SHE WANTS A PAIR OF HEADPHONES LIKE THE ONES I HAVE NOW.\n",
      "So after a week of owning these earphones, I forgot them in my pocket and they accidentally went through the washing machine AND the dryer. I thought that I had wasted 30 bucks and thought they were garbage. For the fun of it, I tried to see if they worked and amazingly they did! I'm still using them. Great earphones and great sound and quality!\n",
      "This generation of ear-pods work better than the previous generation. Clear bright sound. they fit better in the ear canal too, comfortable fit\n",
      "I bought these to get a pair of headphones that werent actually \"in-ear\". For 7$ I didn't expect them to be legit, but it said it was from apple - that is a blatant LIE. They are not in fact from Apple, but are fake. The slits on the sides aren't real and the speakers inside are crappy. If you want cheap headphones that sound cheap then get them otherwise go look for something else.\n",
      "Nice sound and fits snug in the ear.  If I tried to take these away, she would probably break my arm.\n",
      "Not sure why Apple thinks these were something to be proud of.  Where they better than the original ones... sure.  But they are still some of the worst earbuds I've ever used.  Made my ears hurt after 5 minutes.  I'll stick to my Klipsch S4's for a great inexpensive earbud.\n",
      "A personal thumbs-up for these things, I really love them. The sound quality is excellent, the basses are good and deep, and there's little sound bleed-out unless they're at top volume. The mic in the control has made itself very very useful; I can have a convo on the phone without having to put down my stitching or letting the computer sit idle. Yes, I know that's what Bluetooth is for, but I don't need to fuss about with a separate device, now, do I, which is good, because I hate that (which is why I don't have a separate iPod). The remote works great, and I don't have to take my iPhone out of my pocket when I'm listening to something in order to adjust volume or change the track. One serious advantage for me that I hadn't anticipated: they're comfortable enough that I can easily fall asleep wearing them (which means Bono sings me to sleep a lot--rather an intimate series of encounters for a man I've never actually met). I seem to always have them in, which is a testament to their comfort in that I often forget I'm even wearing them. My *only* fuss is that I can't blast them so loud that my eardrums break, but that's a good thing, I suppose. Damn safety feature.\n",
      "good product\n",
      "we use alots of headsets for lots of things. we tried cheaper one for the ipod and ipad but they always had issues. SO we went ahead and got these. havent had an issue yet works great on both devices. also works on non apple apps such as skype.\n",
      "It has good sound quality with bass effect. It is light. But my ear pains since there is no cushion. Should improve that.\n",
      "When i received my \"Apple EarPods\" I was a bit confused. These EarPods had differences than the EarPods I bought from an Apple store. After about 2 days these poorly made EarPods broke. The wires near the input area were showing, the insides where falling out, the volume control stopped working, and soon I was no longer able to put the jack into my iPod! Keep in mind that I've only had these for TWO DAYS.\n",
      "These ear pods fit nice and don't fall out when running.  The sound quality is good as well.  My favorite pair and I have tried a lot of different kinds.\n",
      "it's not the highest quality, but for the price and it's intended use, it packs a powerful punch. I don't think anyone's ears are that sensitive to know the difference.\n",
      "The best earphones I've had by far although sometimes I have to unplug and replug my ear pods in order for the volume buttons to work ,other than that their a great buy.\n",
      "These fit well and don't fall out sound is of quality. I have a set of bose ear pods and these are more comfortable than the bose that i payed a lot of money for. The sound they produce is comparable to bose.\n",
      "I'm very satisfied with Apple products in general.This one is an essential company for my new iPad. Very good the new design.\n",
      "Hello, my earpods get to me in very good conditions, and they work perfectly with any Iphone or Ipod  which is great!!!\n",
      "First off they claimed that these are apple earphones but they aren't. They fall apart easily and one earned plays louder than the other. The volume isn't loud at all and forget trying to get the person on the other end to hear or understand what you're saying. It ain't gonna happen. Don't waste your money.\n",
      "I just wanted a pair of replacement bubs for mu iphone. I saw these online for a drop dead price and said....what the h@!! When I tried them out I was astounded at the sound quality! One of the best buys of the year...Thanks a bunch!\n",
      "I am not a fan of these types of earphone, however i really thought they would last at least a while longer. I bought two pair, the extra one was just in case one stopped working, unfortunately for me both were broke within a week of use. For both of them the right ear that is attached to the mic stopped working. Never buying these again and i definitely don't recommend any one else to buy them. Additionally they are uncomfortable in the ear and was more than they are worth.  The sound is just ok, but it is to be expected.\n",
      "still not super happy with these ear buds, but they are better than the original ones. I ended up buying a set of skull candy 2.0 and they are superior in terms of sound and comfort.\n",
      "I don't know if this is a genuine earpod or not.  None of the packaging has any apple markings of any kind.  That aside, the sound quality is very poor...significantly inferior to the earbuds that came with my apple devices originally (and the originals are OK but not wonderful).  I very much doubt that apple would put out such a poor performer.\n",
      "these aren't like the cheap knock-off apple earpods you may have been stuck with in the past claiming to be the real deal. They are packaged in all the apple packaging and work perfectly. I also like the new design of the ear buds. They seem to fit in your ears (or at least my ears) better than the typical round ones and i even seem to get a better sound with fewer outside noises coming through. I will say i even accidentally washed them in a pocket of my pants (oops) and after drying they still worked, the sound quality may not be as good, but hey i'm not complaining after all that.\n",
      "excellent product. I commend you for your attention\n",
      "I really like these! They are much better than the previous apple earbuds. The quality is great and they are much more comfortable than I thought, it doesn't even feel like they are there.\n",
      "Earphones did show my kid uses them daily. He tends to go through them every month or so. I will probably be ordering again next month.\n",
      "At first I did not like the idea of these EarPods - I was a fan of the old-style Apple earbuds.  But after purchasing these and trying them out for a while, I think I actually like them better.  The new model fits better in my ears, although some have reported they do not fit well (and there's no adjustments or interchangeable pieces either).  The design allows for better comfort and it also is better at decreasing outside noise.  Also, I noticed that the sound quality (particular low frequencies) is much better with these new EarPods.  Also, the built-in volume controls on the cord works well my iPhone and my Macbook Pro - unfortunately the volume controls do not seem to work for most non-Apple products.\n",
      "Three things these headphones are not:\n",
      "unfortunately this does not fit comfortably for many people. Also, it does not work at all with my Moto RAZR MAXX, which is very disappointing. I have to use my old buds with my work phone, if it were my personal phone I would have given a lower rating.\n",
      "My hearing isn't the best and I haven't heard music this well for many years I would recommend these ear pods to anyone that enjoys listening to music and hearing everything !!!!\n",
      "This r awesome. if u love bass this ear pods are right for you. i love them and they are worth a penny. the Mic is awesome nd the remote is awesome to.\n"
